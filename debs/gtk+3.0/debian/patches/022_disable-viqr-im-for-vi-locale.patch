In the Vietnamese Quoted-Readable input method, punctuation following a
base letter is converted into diacritical marks, for example a( → ă.
(See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_Quoted-Readable>.)
A 2008 bug report in Ubuntu argued that this is a problematic default,
particularly when typing passwords, where the effect of the punctuation
is non-obvious.

According to the bug reporter, VIQR is popular with Vietnamese users
living elsewhere in the world, where Vietnamese keyboards are unlikely
to be readily available, but is not a popular choice within Vietnam,
where the Telex or VNI input modes are preferred.
