Subject: clutter/x11: Consider remapped keys when guessing the keycode from
 the keysym

Since e3e933c4 a keyval can be temporarily remapped to an unused keycode. Due to
some limitations in XTestFakeKeyEvent, the remapping has to be done in the first
xkb group/layout. In case there are two or more keyboard layouts enabled and the
selected keyboard layout is not the first, clutter_keymap_x11_keycode_for_keyval
will fail to retrieve the correct keycode for a remapped keyval. Let's use the
reserved_keycodes map in order to retrieve the correct keycode if needed.

(cherry picked from commit e0811ce1416f93906026a18fda4cd6811594cfb2)
