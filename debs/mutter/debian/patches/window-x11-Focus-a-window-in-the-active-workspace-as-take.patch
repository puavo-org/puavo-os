Subject: window-x11: Focus a window in the active workspace as take-focus
 fallback

Starting with commit 2db94e2e we try to focus a fallback default focus window
if no take-focus window candidate gets the input focus when we request it and
we limit the focus candidates to the current window's workspace.

However, if the window is unmanaging, the workspace might be unset, and we could
end up in deferencing a NULL pointer causing a crash.

So, in case the window's workspace is unset, just use the currently active
workspace for the display.

(cherry picked from commit 5ca0ef078d39548edda1a97e9066d44aa8f38108)
