cups-filters (1.14.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  This release adds the "--enable-auto-setup-driverless" ./configure
  option. With this option set, cups-browsed creates queues for all
  discovered IPP network printers on the local network which support
  driverless printing (IPP Everywhere or Apple AirPrint).
