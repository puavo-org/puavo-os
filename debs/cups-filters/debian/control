Description: OpenPrinting CUPS Filters - cups-browsed
 This package provides cups-browsed, a daemon which browses the Bonjour
 broadcasts of shared remote CUPS printers and makes the printers
 available locally, replacing the CUPS broadcasting/browsing which was
 dropped in CUPS 1.6.x. This way the old behavior of having the remote
 printers available automatically is now re-implemented with Bonjour.
 .
 cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 client to allow the
 latter to browse the printer list of CUPS < 1.6 servers (by using the
 old 'cups' protocol in BrowseRemoteProtocols).
