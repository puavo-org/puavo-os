  * debian/patches/ipp-backend-did-not-send-cancel-request-to-printers-when-a
    -job-was-canceled-and-printer-did-not-support-create-job.patch:
    The IPP backend did not send a cancel request to printers when a job was
    canceled and the printer did not support Create-Job. This is to improve the
    "ipp" backend as much as possible to reduce the ned of the "ipp14" backend
    ("ipp" backend of CUPS 1.4.x added to the Debian/Ubuntu package as fallback
    in case of regressions of the current "ipp" backend).
  * debian/patches/work-around-some-broken-ipp-printers.patch: Work around

    Prevent IPP backend from falling into an infinite loop in certain
    situations (CUPS STR #4194).
  * debian/patches/fix-make-check.patch: Fix "make check".
  * debian/patches/ubuntu/ubuntu-disable-browsing.patch: Updated.
  * debian/cups.install: Removed all references to the discontinued cups-polld.
  * debian/rules: Removed lines for deletion of filters, fonts and glyphs which
    have moved to cups-filters and also the line for commenting out conversion
    rules.
  * debian/rules, debian/cups.install, debian/cups-common.install: Do not
    install fonts and charsets, there are none any more in CUPS.
  * debian/control, debian/libcupsdriver1-dev.install,
    debian/libcupsdriver1.symbols, debian/libcupsdriver1.install:
    libcupsdriver.so got moved to cups-filters as part of libcupsfilters.so.
  * debian/libcupsimage2-dev.install: image.h removed, this API has moved to
    cups-filters.
  * debian/rules: Removed "--with-remote_protocols='CUPS dnssd'" from the
    ./configure command line and removed the "CUPS" from
    "--with-local_protocols='CUPS dnssd'". These settings are not supported
    any more in CUPS 1.6.x.
  * debian/rules, debian/libcups2-dev.examples: Removed references to scripting/
    this subdirectory does not exist any more in CUPS 1.6.x.
  * debian/libcups2.symbols, debian/libcupsimage2.symbols: Refreshed using the
    diff of the dpkg-gensymbols output during build.
  * debian/cups.postinst: Clean /etc/cups/cupsd.conf from all keywords and
    settings which got obsolete with the dropping CUPS Broadcasting/Browsing
    in CUPS 1.6.x: BrowsePoll, BrowseAllow, BrowseDeny, BrowseOrder, and
    BrowseRemoteProtocols lines get removed and the "cups" argument gets
    removed from the BrowseLocalProtocols line (LP: #1052897).
  * Split the "cups" binary package into "cups" and "cups-daemon".
    Installation of "cups-daemon" without "cups" gives a CUPS
    environment for raw queues only, especially as a client-only mode
    with queues pointing to remote printers set up automatically with
    cups-browsed from cups-filters. This environment gives basic
    printing support on low-footprint mobile systems, like Ubuntu for
    Android.

cups (1.5.3-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/usb-backend-further-enhancements.patch: Added latest
    development work on the libusb-based USB backend:
     - Support for uni-directional devices, both protocol-1 devices and
       devices where no read endpoint is found.
     - Soft reset specific to the "PRINTER" device class. This allows a
       reset without reconnecting.
     - When closing the device, it will also get reset to its original
       configuration, before re-attaching the usblp kernel module. Do not
       restore the configuration setting when the old configuration was zero,
       as zero means "unconfigured".
     - Added option "usb-unidir" to force the backend into uni-directional
       mode. This allows to work around problems with bi-di communications,
       especially also a delay at the end of the job caused by closing the
       read channel (happens only for some devices, LP: #1001028). Also
       useful for debugging.
     - Added the quirk management of the usblp kernel module. So the problems
       of all printers which were worked around in the kernel module are
       also worked around in the libusb-based CUPS backend now (LP: #1000253).
     - Added new quirk type to quirk manager: Printers for which the usblp
       kernel module should not get reattached after printing a job
       (LP: #1000253, perhaps also LP: #995111).
     - Added additional quirks for the Prolific Technology USB -> Parallel
       adapter, as the adapter needs uni-directional mode to be forced and
       also does not like re-attaching the usblp kernel module after the
       job (last third of last page gets cut off, re-attaching probably
       sends a reset to the printer while there is still data to be printed
       in the printer's internal buffer (LP: #987485).
     - Added the command line option "usb-no-reattach". With the option set
       the usblp kernel module does not get reattached after a job has been
       printed. Some printers cut off the end of the job or even crash by
       re-attaching the module. This is a development/debug mode to test
       whether re-attaching was the culprit of a problem. Users should
       report such issues so that their printers can get added to the quirk
       list.
     - Some extra debug messages.
     - Added a missing libusb_free_config_descriptor().
    This patch is submitted upstream as CUPS STR #4128.
  * debian/patches/add-ipp-backend-of-cups-1.4.patch, debian/cups.config,
    debian/cups.lintian-overrides, debian/cups.postinst, debian/cups.prerm,
    debian/cups.templates: Add the IPP backend of CUPS 1.4.x to the current
    CUPS package as independent backend "ipp14". Some devices (like the
    LiveBox 2) do not work with the current IPP backend (LP: #945028,
    LP: #973270, LP: #990734, LP: #992468, LP: #992982).
  * debian/patches/ipp-backend-cups-1.5.4-fixes.patch: Backported latest
    fixes on the IPP backend from upstream.

       re-attaching the module. This is a development/debug mode to test
       whether re-attaching was the culprit of a problem. Users should
       report such issues so that their printers can get added to the quirk
       list.
     - debian/patches/usb-backend-further-enhancements.patch: USB backend: Do
       a printer reset after each job, this makes the Prolific USB -> Parallel
       adapter finally work (LP: #987485) and makes it unnecessary to
       blacklist the usblp kernel module for some printers (LP: #997040).
     - Some extra debug messages.
     - Added a missing libusb_free_config_descriptor().
    This patch is submitted upstream as CUPS STR #4128.
  * debian/local/blacklist-cups-usblp.conf, debian/cups.maintscript,

  * debian/patches/commandtops-make-robust-against-broken-postscript.patch:
    CUPS' commandtops filter allows auto-configuration of the default option
    settings of PostScript printers querying the printer using PostScript
    commands defined in the PPD file ("*?..." entries). Problem is that if
    one of the query commands has a PostScript error (rather common in
    manufacturer-supplied PPD files) the printer errors out and ignores all
    subsequent queries putting the auto-configuration job into a 90-second
    timeout for each query. This patch protects the job against failures
    on broken PostScript and shortens the timeout to 10 seconds, so that
    as many options as possible get auto-configured in a reasonable time.
    Thanks to Helge Blischke for applying the needed PostScript tricks
    (CUPS STR #4028). Now auto-configuration of PostScript printers actually
    works by sending a job like "echo -en '#CUPS-COMMAND\nAutoConfigure\n' |
    lp -d <printer>" which could be done by a button in a printer setup tool.

  * debian/patches/ipp-patch-r8950+.patch: Revert the IPP backend to the state
    of CUPS 1.4.x, as the 1.5.x versiuon has major regressions (LP: #877958,

    CUPS STR #3967). This patch will get removed as soon as upstream has fixed
    all these regressions. As upstream did not announce any new features for
    the IPP backend in the release notes for 1.5.x, we assume that with this
    step no features will get lost.
  * debian/patches/dont-send-malformed-dbus-messages.patch: Do not send D-Bus
    notifications with too few parameters when there are parameters which
    cannot be added to the D-Bus request, especially invalid UTF-8 strings.
    This made gnome-session-daemon crash (LP: #893676, CUPS STR #3984).

  * debian/cups.postinst: Clear PPD cache when upgrading from an older version

  * debian/cups.postinst: Fixes on the PPD updater:
     o Added "return 0" at the end of the ppd_updater() function, otherwise
       the progrem terminates at its end and so only the first updater file
       in /usr/share/cups/ppd-updaters/ is treated.
     o Added quotes around parameter names to conserve the special characters
       of the regexps.
     o Made sure that when regexps are applied to the lines of the temporary
       files that the resulting lines have still single newlines at their ends.
     o Log for which drivers the PPDs get updated.

    libusb-based "usb" backend accept also the old device URIs from the

  * debian/filters/pstopdf: Let pstopdf determine the page size via
    the "PageSize" or "PageRegion" setting in the 5th command line
    argument and not via "media". The "media" setting is usually
    inserted by CUPS and uses a PWG name of the paper size and not the
    name used in the PPD file. This makes Ghostscript being called
    without paper size setting and so a PDF file in the default paper
    size (A4/Letter) is passed on, breaking any printout from applications
    which send jobs in PostScript and which have a non-default paper
    size (LP: #787635).

  * debian/patches/cups-avahi.dpatch: Added patch from Tim Waugh from Red Hat
    to implement full Avahi support, not only for printer discovery by the
    "dnssd" backend but also for print queue broadcasting and browsing by the
    scheduler (CUPS daemon). Fixes LP: #465916.
  * debian/patches/dnssd-avahi.dpatch: Removed, is part of new
    cups-avahi.dpatch.
  * debian/patches/quiesce-bonjour-warning.dpatch: Removed, not needed any
    more with the new cups-avahi.dpatch.
  * debian/rules: Added "--with-local_protocols='CUPS dnssd'
    --with-remote_protocols='CUPS dnssd'" to the command line of "./configure".
    This adds support for DNS-SD-based browsing and broadcasting by default.
  * debian/patches/configure-default-browse-protocols.dpatch: Fixed handling
    of "--with-local_protocols=..." and "--with-remote_protocols=..." on the
    command line of "./configure". Now (quoted) values with spaces, like
    "CUPS dnssd" are treated correctly.
  * debian/patches/usb-backend-no-segfault-on-bad-device-id.dpatch: Assure
    that the device ID string read from a USB device can never be a mess: Try
    other byte order for device ID string length also if length is too small,
    empty the read device ID string if there is an IOCTL failure, reject ID
    strings with unprintable characters, clean white space in the ID string,
    and finally accept the empty ID string as an unknown device. This
    overcomes the problem that USB-to-Parallel adapter cables do not
    report back a usable ID string. With these changes it is at least possible
    to use one adapter cable per computer if the cables do not report unique
    serial numbers via libusb and any number of adapter cables if they do
    report serial numbers via libusb. Real USB printers can always be used,
    also if there are other printers connected with an adapter cable
    (LP: #468701, LP: #564917).

   18. Bonjour (DNS-SD) perforance tuning; the scheduler now only uses a
       single file descriptor for printer sharing. It previously used one
       per printer.
   19. Bonjour (DNS-SD) web interface registry; when remote access is
       enabled, the scheduler can register the web interface for easier
       access.
   20. LPD client support; the cups-lpd mini-daemon now provides the
       document-name for print jobs and supports specification of a CUPS
       server.
   21. PWG Port Monitor MIB; the snmp backend now supports the PWG Port
       Monitor MIB to better choose the device URI to use.
   22. SNMP-based monitoring; the ipp, lpd, and socket backends now report
       supply levels and printer status using SNMP queries.
   23. IPP/2.x support; CUPS now conforms to the draft IPP/2.0 and IPP/2.1
       specifications.
   24. CUPS-Add-Modify-Printer operation; the scheduler now supports
       setting the printer-state-reasons attribute using this operation.
   25. CUPS-Get-Document operation; the scheduler now supports a "get
       document" operation to download files from a print job.
   26. Device location; the scheduler and backend discovery interface now
       support a device-location attribute.
   27. Hold-New-Jobs and Release-Held-New-Jobs operations; the scheduler
       now supports the Hold-New-Jobs and Release-Held-New-Jobs
       operations.
   28. Access control; the scheduler now supports multiple addresses in
       Allow and Deny lines. It also now returns a HTTP 403 (forbidden)
       status when a user authenticates successfully but is not allowed to
       perform an operation.
   29. Access logging; the scheduler now supports an AccessLogLevel
       directive to control what is logged in the access_log file.
   30. Configuration files; the default cupsd.conf file now provides an
       "authenticated" policy for easy authenticated sharing of printers.
   31. Default LogLevel; the default LogLevel is now "warn" instead of
       "info".
   32. Automatic debug logging; the scheduler now records up to the last N
       (default 200) debug messages for failed print jobs.
   33. Default paper size; the scheduler now supports a DefaultPaperSize
       directive to override the default paper size defined by the locale
       or libpaper configuration.
   34. Encryption support; the scheduler now supports a SSLOptions
       directive to optionally support Windows clients in "FIPS" mode. It
       also now loads both the server and CA certificates (if present)
       from the ServerCertificate file.
   35. Error logging; the scheduler now logs unsuccessful operations as
       errors in the error_log file.
   36. Error policies; the scheduler now supports a retry-current-job
       error policy that retries the current job immediately.
   37. Fatal error handling; the scheduler now supports a FatalErrors
       directive to control which startup errors should be considered
       fatal.
   38. Filter command-line; the scheduer now passes the
       job-originating-host-name attribute as a CUPS option to filters and
       backends.
   39. Filter environment; the scheduler now includes CUPS_JOBTYPE,
       PRINTER_INFO, and PRINTER_LOCATION variables in the environment
       passed to filters and backends.
   40. Job progress; the scheduler now supports a job-media-progress
       attribute to track the printing progress of each page.
   41. MIME database; MIME types now support a priority attribute to
       override the default (alphabetical) rules of precedence.
   42. Page logging; the scheduler now supports a PageLogFormat directive
       to control the format of the page_log file.
   43. PAM support; the scheduler now sets more PAM attributes to better
       support third-party authentication schemes.
   44. PDF job ticket support; the scheduler now supports cupsJobTicket
       comments at the beginning of PDF print jobs.
   45. Performance tuning; the scheduler now coalesces configuration and
       state file changes to reduce the amount of disk activity and caches
       printer attributes to further reduce startup time.
   46. Printcap support; the scheduler no longer clears the printcap file
       when shutting down, and can now create XML "plist" printcap files
       as well.
   47. RSS subscriptions; the scheduler now starts the notifier for RSS
       subscriptions after creation so the feed is available immediately.
   48. Sandbox support; the scheduler now runs child processes using
       restrictive policies on Mac OS X for improved security and job
       isolation.
   49. Test option; the scheduler now supports a test mode via the "-t"
       option.
   50. Device discovery; the cups-deviced helper now runs backends in
       parallel for faster discovery and streams the results of discovery
       as the backends provide them.
   51. Driver development kit; the CUPS DDK is now a standard part of
       CUPS.
   52. Driver information file support; the cups-driverd helper program
       now directly supports PPD compiler driver information files.
   53. Dynamic PPD support; drivers can now set PPD keywords dynamically
       using PPD: messages.
   54. Generic PostScript command filter; a new CUPS command file filter
       for PostScript printers provides auto-configuration, self-test
       page, and status and supply level reporting functions.
   55. New printer drivers; new generic PostScript and PCL drivers provide
       improved support for laser printers, the CUPS DDK drivers offer
       support for many HP DesignJet printers, and new label drivers offer
       support for Seiko and Tharo label printers.
   56. PJL support; the cupsPJLDisplay PPD attribute controls the PJL
       commands used to display the current user and job on the printer.
   57. PPD compiler improvements; the PPD compiler now supports Mac OS X
       .strings files, OID query strings, conditional directives, long
       file names, and a test mode. It also fixes many other bugs from the
       CUPS DDK 1.2.3 release.
   58. USB printer support; the usb backend now uses libusb when available
       to allow it to better work with third-party scanning and printing
       solutions.
   59. Banner filter; the bundled banner ("job-sheets") pages are now
       generated using a new banner filter provides easier customization
       and better support for UTF-8 text.
   60. Image filters; the standard image filters now support image files
       larger than 2GB.
   61. PDF filter; the pdftops filter has been replaced with a wrapper
       program that runs the Xpdf, poppler, or Ghostscript PDF to
       PostScript utilities.
   62. Backend API; a new cupsBackendReport function is provided to report
       a device from a backend and handles any needed quoting of the
       make-and-model, info, device-id, and location strings.
   63. Device discovery; the new cupsGetDevices function streams
       discovered devices to an application-provided callback function.
   64. IPP API; the IPP read and write functions no longer use a large
       stack-based buffer when reading and writing IPP attributes.
   65. PPD support; several new functions are provided: cupsGetPPD3,
       cupsResolveConflicts, ppdInstallableConflict, ppdLocalizeAttr,
       ppdLocalizeMarkerName and ppdPageSizeLimits.
   66. Side-Channel API; new cupsSideChannelSNMPGet and
       cupsSideChannelSNMPWalk functions allow printer drivers to do SNMP
       queries via the standard network backends.
   67. Streaming API; a new streaming request API provides asynchronous
       job creation and request submission.

cups (1.3.11-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * debian/cups.init.d: Trigger udev event for all USB printers right after
    starting the CUPS daemon to run the udev callouts for the printers. This
    allows automatic print queue setup and re-enabling print queues also if
    the printer is cold-plugged (connected before CUPS and/or udev got
    started).
  * debian/cups.init.d: Set CUPS RIP cache to 1/4 of the total RAM when CUPS
    is started. This way CUPS Raster drivers get enough memory for reliable
    and quick operation even if large paper sizes with high resolutions are
    printed.
  * debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/pdftoopvp/OPVPOutputDev.cxx,
    debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/pdftoopvp/OPVPOutputDev.h,
    debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/pdftoopvp/pdftoopvp.cxx,
    debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/pdftoopvp/opvp/opvp.h,
    debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/pdftoopvp/opvp/opvp_0_2_0.h: Adapted
    pdftoopvp filter to the new API of Poppler 0.11.2. Thanks to upstream
    author Koji Otani for the patch.
  * debian/rules: Explicitly create empty file pdftoopvp/Dependencies after
    applying the PDF filters add-on as the build servers seem to not copy
    empty files.
  * debian/patches/default_log_warn.dpatch,
    debian/patches/default_log_settings.dpatch: Renamed patch for cupsd.conf
    logging settings and added "MaxLogSize 0" so that CUPS does not do its
    own log rotation, as our log rotation is much better.
  * debian/cups-bsd.postinst, debian/cups.postinst: Moved handling of
    /etc/printcap symlink from the post-install script of the cups-bsd
    package to the cups package. Should assure that the symlink gets
    also set on initial system installation (LP: #415825).
  * debian/local/filters/cpdftocps: Updated filter to not use the pdftops
    filter of CUPS, as from version 1.3.11 on CUPS' pdftops filter integrates
    the call of pstops, and in the PDF workflow this would duplicate the
    application of page management options, like N-up, even/odd pages, and
    even the number of copies for some printers (LP: #412709).

    PPD option) did not work (LP: #396673).
  * debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/filter/imagetopdf.c: imagetopdf proceeded
    the PDF output with a blank line. This made some filters misbehave.
  * debian/patches/read-embedded-options-from-incoming-postscript-and-add-to-ipp-attrs.dpatch:
    Make CUPS read the number of copies out of Windows print jobs reliably by
    also considering lines like "%%BeginNonPPDFeature: NumCopies 2". Thanks to
    Dan Sheridan from Adelard (djs at adelard dot com) for this improvement of
    the patch.

cups (1.3.10-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/read-embedded-options-from-incoming-postscript-and-add-to-ipp-attrs.dpatch:
    Make CUPS reading all option settings in PostScript print jobs and add the
    option settings to the filter command line before starting the filter chain.
    This fixes the problem that in the PDF printing workflow (where incoming
    PostScript gets converted to PDF by pstopdf) option settings embedded in the
    incoming PostScript code do not get obeyed. Especially the options of jobs
    from Windows clients get ignored.
  * debian/filters/pstopdf: Do not let Ghostscript generate multiple copies
    of the job if the filter command line from CUPS already supplies the
    correct number of copies.
  * debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/addtocups: The disabling of the
    pdftoopvp filter in cups 1.3.10-3 also disabled pdftopdf. Re-enabled
    pdftopdf.

  * debian/cups.install, debian/rules: Move added *.convs and *.types files to
    /usr/share/cups/mime/ so that they are not considered config files
    by dpkg.
  * debian/local/text.convs: Turn all text input formats to text/plain at
    a high cost, so that the text-only printer (which accepts only text/plain)
    accepts them (LP: #385797).
  * debian/rules: Switch the pdftops filter back to Poppler, as Ghostscript
    has a lot of problems in generating PostScript (LP: #382379).
  * debian/patches/poppler-based-pdftops-fixes.dpatch: Fixes for the pdftops
    filter in Poppler mode: Do not emit PostScript level 3 as it Poppler's
    PostScript level 3 output is not compatible with HP's PostScript printers
    (LP: #277404); Added support for the new "-origpagesizes" option of
    Poppler's pdftops, so that documents with pages of different sizes get
    correctly printed (LP: #310575).
  * debian/filters/pstopdf: Do not call Ghostscript with asymmetric resolutions
    (like 1200x600 dpi), as it leads to problems with images in some cases.

  * debian/cups.install: Make /etc/fonts/conf.d/99pdftoopvp.conf of pdftoopvp
    be installed as part of the cups package
  * debian/control: Added build dependencies needed by pdftoopvp: liblcms1-dev,
    libfreetype6-dev, libfontconfig1-dev
  * debian/control: Moved dependency on cups-client to Depends:, as
    cups-client is needed by the post-install script for the update of the
    PPDs of existing print queues.
  * debian/cups.postinst: Case-insensitive check for model names when updating
    PPDs of already existing print queues.

  * debian/control: Drop ghostscript build dependency again, pdftops filter
    uses poppler again. Also Drop alternative xpdf-utils build dependency,
    since configure now checks for poppler's pdftops capabilities.
  * debian/control, debian/rules: Do a build-time check if pdftops supports
    -origpagesizes, and dynamically set the poppler-utils dependency. This is
    a hack until https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19777 makes it
    into Debian.
  * debian/cups.install, debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/addtocups: Disable

      This PostScript contains code which stops Ghostscript with an error when
      one tries to convert it to (now unencrypted) PDF. Change the filter to
      normalize such PostScript using ps2ps before conversion.

  * debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/filter/texttopdf.c: Added bug fix
    from upstream so that texttopdf does not segfault on missing or bad
    fonts any more. Backed out Johan Kiviniemi's patch of replacing
    Courier by FreeMono.
  * Remove hardcoded -march=pentium from texttopdf Makefile.

    - Add an application/vnd.cups-pdf → application/vnd.cups-postscript
      filter, thus making the PDF filter chain possible for PostScript
      printers.
    - The filter’s cost is 22, making the total cost of pstopdf → pdftopdf →
      cpdftocps 66 after the following change.
  * debian/local/filters/pdf-filters/conf/pdftopdf.convs,

    - Do not log to /tmp/pstopdf.log. A user running the filter (e.g. via
      cupsfilter) made all other users (including cups itself) unable to run
      the filter because of no permission to open the logfile.

    Introduced the first bunch of infrastructure for using PDF as standard
    print job format. Added CUPS filters imagetopdf, pstopdf, pdftopdf,
    pdftoraster, added build dependency on libpoppler-dev, as the new filters

    All this is temporary, as the filters are planned to be added to the
    upstream package of CUPS (CUPS STR #2897, #1595).
  * debian/patches/search_mime_files_in_usr_share.dpatch: Replaced by the
    changes which were done for this purpose in CUPS 1.4. In addition to
    the introduction of /usr/share/cups/mime for installing file detection and
    conversion rules as non-conffiles it also changes the reading order to
    all *.types files and the all *.convs files (instead of all in
    /usr/share/cups/mime and then all in /etc/cups). This way
    /usr/share/cups/mime can contain conversion rules based on file types

    those 1.3 MB by default on every system, this is much more developer
    oriented. Mention this in the package description.
  * debian/rules: Explicitly build with -fno-stack-protector on arm and armel,
    since the compiler produces segfaulting binaries. Works around #469517.
  * search_mime_files_in_usr_share.dpatch: Do not fatally fail if
    DataDir/mime does not exist. This both makes much more sense (since
    /etc/cups is the canonical dir which must exist, and /usr/share/cups/mime
    is optional), and also unbreaks the test suite (which does not create this
    directory by default).
  * pidfile.dpatch: Specify PidFile in temporary directory in the self test's
    cupsd.conf.
  * debian/rules clean: Remove test suite HTML reports.
  * Add testsuite-exit-code.dpatch: Exit with nonzero if the test suite fails,
    so that it is easier to integrate into package building.
  * pdftops-cups-1.4.dpatch: Update pdftops location in test suite, too, so
    that it does not fail the PDF printing test. (Forwarded to STR #2759)
  * debian/rules: Run test suite on build. This will fail the build if any
    tests fail, so that problems on particular platforms will be caught
    easily.
  * debian/control: Add alternative (build-)depends to heimdal-dev.
  * debian/rules, debian/cupsys.postinst: Call update-rc.d to not install stop
    symlinks for runlevels 0 and 6, since they just needlessly slow down
    shutdown. Remove the obsolete kill symlinks on upgrade. Patch adopted from
    the Ubuntu branch, but without using the Ubuntu-only 'multiuser' mode of
    update-rc.d.
  * Add debian/local/apparmor-profile: AppArmor profile (taken from Ubuntu
    branch). Install it in debian/rules if package is built on Ubuntu (tested
    with lsb_release -is). Reload AppArmor in debian/cupsys.postinst if both
    the cupsys profile and AppArmor itself are present.
  * Add debian/patches/ubuntu-disable-browsing.dpatch: Disable Browsing by
    default when building on Ubuntu.
  * Add debian/patches/ubuntu-default-error-policy-retry-job.dpatch: Set
    default job error policy to "Retry", since it is less confusing and a
    better default on desktop machines. This is only applied when building on

  * Dropped cupsd.conf-AllowLocal.dpatch; it does not do anything good any
    more for the current web and GUI administration tools (they handle this

  [ Kenshi Muto ]
  * Bumps up shlibs to 1.3.4.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/control: Remove gs-esp alternative dependency, it's just
    "ghostscript" nowadays.
  * debian/control: Slightly bump the C/R: for -common; it's a pointless delta
    to Ubuntu and it doesn't hurt us.
  * debian/cupsys-bsd.postinst: Symlink cupsys-bsd's doc directory to
    cupsys-common's, not cupsys', since the latter is not a dependency.
  * debian/control: Demote cups-pdf from Recommends: to Suggests: to match the

  * Add debian/local/backends/dnssd: Printer discovery backend for
    several cheaper printers, like the HP Color LaserJet 2600n, are not
    discovered by the "snmp" backend.  In addition, this backend extracts more
    info from the printers than the "snmp" backend, like for example available
    page description languages.  This leads to better driver choices for
    unknown printer models.
  * debian/cupsys.install, debian/cupsys.{prerm,postinst,templates,rules}:
    Install new backend.
  * debian/control: Add Recommends: to avahi-utils; if it is installed, the
    dnssd backend can actually work.

    default upstream.
  * debian/patches: Drop number prefixes from patches. The enumeration is not
    useful at all any more since it both got inflated and is not sorted by any

    61_job_c_strangeloop.dpatch, 08_cupsd.conf.conf.d.dpatch,
    64_driverfolder.dpatch.
  * Add debian/patches/14_dont_force_ssl.dpatch: Do not require SSL for /admin
    pages, since gnome-cups-manager (and most probably other GUI frontends)
    does not support this.
  * Add debian/patches/58_cupsd.conf-AllowLocal.dpatch: Allow access to local
    ethernet by default. This just affects the ACL, for actually enabling
    access cupsd needs to be switched to not only listen on localhost. With
    that, this setting does not need to be configured in two different places.
  * Add debian/patches/70_reactivate_recommended_driver.dpatch: Upstream CUPS
    filters the "(recommended)" marking from the NickNames of the PPD files
    when listing PPDs. These are an important orientation for the user and
    they are also made use of by some printer setup tools. We need them at
    least until a better solution for recommending drivers gets available.
  * Add debian/patches/98_search_mime_files_in_usr_share.dpatch: Let CUPS also
    search for *.types and *.convs files in /usr/share/cups/mime. This way
    packages can provide *.types and *.convs files which do not get considered
    as conffiles. (See https://launchpad.net/36532 for details).
  * debian/patches/*.dpatch: Forwarded a lot of patches to upstream bug
    tracker, add STR URLs to dpatch DP: headers.

  Synchronize packaging with Ubuntu:

  * debian/control: Drop transitional libcupsys2-gnutls10 package, it was only
    required for Sarge->Etch upgrades.
  * debian/control: Change netbase dependency to update-inetd, since that
    lives in its own package now.
  * debian/local/enable_sharing: Also match on 127.0.0.1 IP adresses in
    addition to 'localhost'.
  * debian/rules: Most of the clean:: rule is obsolete, only two files are
    left behind now. These two have been reported upstream in
    http://www.cups.org/str.php?L2366.
  * debian/cupsys.templates: Activate SCSI, serial, and SNMP backends by
    default. With these backends activated, many printers can be easily set up
    with the printer setup tools.  Especially network printers get
    auto-detected and the correct URI gets assigned to them (doing this
    manually is a non-trivial task for most users).
  * debian/cupsys.dirs: Add /usr/share/ppd/custom/, a place where lpadmins can
    store additional PPDs (this functionality is e. g. provided in
    gnome-cups-manager's "Custom driver..." file dialog).
  * debian/cupsys.init.d: Give proper permissions to /usr/share/ppd/custom/:
    root:lpadmin 3775. Drop the obsolete chmod/chowning of
    /usr/share/cups/model.
  * Run the backend as non-root system user to confine the impact of security
    vulnerabilities:
    - Add debian/patches/10_external_pam_helper.dpatch:
      + Add a helper program 'cups-check-pam-auth' which performs PAM
        authentication and returns the status as exit code.
      + scheduler/auth.c, cupsdAuthorize(): Attempt to use
        cups-check-pam-auth before trying native PAM.
      + With this we do not need to put the cupsys user into the shadow group.
    - debian/cupsys.files: Install PAM helper.
    - debian/cupsys.postinst: Set permissions of PAM helper to cupsys:shadow
      2754, alter permissions of some configuration files and directories to
      work with non-root cupsd.
    - debian/cupsys.postinst: Fix /var/cache/cups/ permissions for upgrades
      which might have written cache files as root.
    - debian/cupsys.logrotate: Save log files as cupsys:lpadmin.
    - debian/cupsys.init.d: Disable 'reload'; change force-reload to restart,
      since cupsd cannot reload as non-root.
    - debian/cupsys.init.d: Set up proper permissions of log files.
    - debian/rules: Enable --enable-privilege-dropping configure option.
    - debian/rules: Install lpd backend suid root, so that it can bind to
      ports < 1024 (really silly, but required for RFC compliance).
    - debian/cupsys-client.postinst, debian/cupsys.postinst: Set up cupsys
      system user.
  * debian/NEWS: Describe derooting.

  * debian/patches/09_runasuser.dpatch: Do not drop additional group

    them).
  * debian/local/{enable_browsing,browsing_status}: Adapt to single-file
    configuration file style.
  * Add debian/local/{enable_sharing,sharing_status}: Similar to
    enable_browsing and browsing_status, this switches between "Listen
    localhost:631" and "Port 631" (just as the web interface does). Install

  * Split locale files to new package "cupsys-common". (closes: #378659)
    This package is used by cupsys and cupsys-client/cupsys-bsd.
  * removed 26_modprobe: because parallel backend executes with user 'lp'
    permission, modprobe can't work. We CUPS team believe it's better
    that lp module is loaded by discover or any other hardware detection

  * Enable LDAP support.
  * Remove duplicated update-rc.d (closes: #356911)
  * Stopped asking admin password because it works only if user chooses
    digest authentication. The default configuration of Debian uses
    PAM and basic authentication.
  * Enable dbus support.
  * 03_clean.dpatch: Remove produced and remained files during build.
  * Now CUPS uses 'lp' user/group privilege to call backend or any other
    programs.
    CUPS SystemGroup is 'lpadmin'. You need to add users who are allowed
    to add/modify/remove printers/jobs/classes.
  * Remove image.h.patch from source. It is no longer needed.
  * 02_configure.dpath: Remove -rpath from configure.
  * Fix typo in cupsys-bsd description. (closes: #362070)
  * Add Galician debconf translation. (closes: #361258)
  * Update Danish debconf translation. (closes: #357969)
  * Use 'reload' during logrotate instead of 'restart'. It looks safe
    on CUPS 1.2. (though job-restart problem still remains)
  * set TZ in init script only if TZ isn't defined yet.
  * Use if-fi structure style for postrotate of logrotate script.
    It solves error when cupsys is not running. (closes: #347641)
  * Unset TMPDIR environment variable before running daemon. (closes: #347829)
  * Removed /etc/cups/pdftops.conf because it was for pdftops of upstream
    version. Debian CUPS uses xpdf-utils wrapper and doesn't need
    pdftops.conf.
  * Notice: /etc/cups/client.conf has been removed upstream.
  * Notice: {dis,en}able have been renamed to cups{dis,en}able.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/patches/48_stdlib.dpatch: Adapted to new upstream version.
  * debian/cupsys.init.d:
    - Fix arguments of start-stop-daemon and remove the hideous kill
      algorithm.
    - Ensure that /var/run/cupsd exists; this makes the init script work with
      /var/run mounted on a tmpfs.
  * debian/libcupsys2-dev.files, debian/libcupsimage2-dev.files: Remove static
    library; upstream does not build them any more, and they are useless
    anyway.
  * Add debian/patches/06_disable_backend_setuid.dpatch: Remove the uid
    changing in scheduler/cups-deviced.c which was introduced recently in
    upstream. It totally breaks device node access (e. g. /dev/lp0 is root:lp
    0660, which is inaccessible for a process which runs as lp:root).
  * debian/rules: Remove --with-cups-user, upstream does not support
    it any more.
  * debian/patches/09_runasuser_fixes.dpatch: RunAsUser was removed upstream;
    rename the patch to 09_runasuser.dpatch and rewrite it:
    - Enclose all changes in an #if CUPS_DROP_PRIVILEGES, so that it is easy to
      enable this feature.
    - scheduler/main.c: Drop privileges after initialization.
    - scheduler/conf.c: If we build with CUPS_DROP_PRIVILEGES, set RunUser to
      User instead of getuid(), since at that point we will always run as root
      (privileges cannot yet be dropped at that point).
    - config-scripts/cups-defaults.m4: Add --enable-privilege-dropping option.
    - config.h.in: Add CUPS_DROP_PRIVILEGES option template.
  * Add debian/patches/09_runasuser_autoconf.dpatch: autoconf changes for
    09_runasuser_fixes.dpatch changes.
  * debian/pdftops: Fix reading from stdin (https://launchpad.net/bugs/17124)
  * debian/cupsys.preinst: Remove dangling /etc/cups/pdftops.conf symlink on
    upgrades to unbreak printing with poppler-utils.
  * debian/control: Add poppler-utils alternative for xpdf-utils dependency.
  * Add debian/patches/12_quiesce_ipp_logging.dpatch:
    - Drop successful IPP messages to log level 'debug' and unsuccessful ones
      to 'info'.
    - Do not flood access_log with successful CUPS-Get-Printers and
      Get-Printer-Attributes queries (which are generated by e. g.
      gnome-cups-icon every 3 seconds).
    - Closes: #280718
  * Add debian/patches/13_default_log_warn.dpatch: Raise default log severity
    to 'warning' to not log gazillions of IPP requests by default. (other part
    of #280718)
  * debian/rules, debian/cupsys.postinst: Remove obsolete /etc/cups/certs and

  * debian/cupsys.preinst: Remove obsolete /etc/cups/certs symlink on upgrades.
  * debian/cupsys-client.files: Install cupstestdsc and manpage.
  * debian/cupsd.init: Have force-reload to reload, not restart.
  * debian/cupsys.logrotate: Use force-reload instead of reload, since the
    latter is not required to exist by Debian Policy.
  * debian/rules: Ship browsing_status and enable_browsing.

      as in 1.1.x; this unbreaks local certificate authorization for cupsd
      when it runs as normal user.
    - scheduler/main.c: When running as non-root, call initgroups() instead of

  [Kenshi Muto]
  * Downgrade port and browse question to low. (closes: #343341)
  * debian/patches/08_cupsd.conf.conf.d.dpatch:
    - Commented out Port/Listen/Browsing in cupsd.conf.in because
      CUPS crashes when there is a duplicate definition!
      (closes: #343251, #343279, ##343285, #343292)
  * Added NEWS to explain how to fix this for 1.1.23-13 users:
    Tweaking cupsd.conf via postinst is a bad idea, so I gave up
    trying to correct this automatically. Instead, comment out the
    Port/Listen/Browsing lines in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf if you had
    already replaced this file by the one from 1.1.23-13.
  * Updated Swedish debconf translation. (closes: #343397)
  * Set seen false flag when ports configuration is failed.
    (closes: #343400)

    This patch is just for users who want to create own pdftops from
    source.
  * Move Port/Listen and Browsing configurations from /etc/cups/
    cupsd.conf to /etc/cups/cups.d/.

    /etc/cups/cups.d/ports.conf: Port/Listen configuration.

    You can configure these values by using "dpkg-reconfigure cupsys".

cupsys (1.1.22-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Replaced upstream pdftops (derived from Xpdf) with pdftops.pl wrapper.
    pdftops.pl is made by Helge Blischke, GNU GPL licensed.

    CUPS 1.1.22 should enter to Sarge ASAP by some security reasons,
    but upstream pdftops prevents to enter because it has libgcc_s.so
    dependency and current gcc 3.4 faces difficult 'unwind' problem.
    Now I believe cupsys 1.1.22-6 can enter soon without waiting
    gcc problem.

    If you want to print PDF files directly, you need to install
    xpdf-utils. pdftops.pl calls pdftops in xpdf-utils package.
  * Fix typo in control file.

cupsys (1.1.22-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release for unstable. Time is over, sarge isn't shipped.
    I checked 1.1.21 to 1.1.22 migration doesn't break ABI quickly,
    but I'm still scared...
  * Apply gcc-4.0 patch for amd64: 37gfxfont.patch (closes: #285601)
  * Do 'restart' instead of 'reload' when log is rotated.
    'reload' sometime causes just shutdown daemon. (Unknown problem)
  * Fix equation in cupsys.postscript. (closes: #285205)
  * Apply Russell's patch: 38httpwait.patch (closes: #284829)
    (This is trial. If there is any grave problem by this, I'll off this
     patch)
    - Made http_wait() handle EINTR.  This bug was causing cups
      to print multiple copies of reports on remote printers.
    - Lengthed the wait in ipp_http_read to handle connections
      running over the internet.  The short wait was causing
      unwated multiple copies of reports to be printed.
    - While both these bugs need to be fixed, neither completely
      solves the original multiple copies problem.  To solve
      that no data should be printed if there was a read error.
  * Add dependency version of smbclient. (closes: #284733)

    built before the libcupsimage split.  Closes: #189175.
  * Move /etc/printcap.cups to /var/run/cups/printcap, since it's

  * Per suggestion from the KDE project, suggest the kdeprint package
    instead of the kdelibs3-cups package.

cupsys (1.1.19candidate1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  I will try to follow upstream's new
    release policy by uploading release candidate versions to
    unstable.
  * Wrote a new GNU TLS patch, which was accepted by upstream.
    Re-enable SSL support based on this.
  * Based on recent upstream work, wrote a libpaper patch which has
    also been accepted upstream.  Closes: #60035, #88597, #101591.
  * Upstream fix included to allow SLP-only browsing support to work.
    Closes: #178380.

  * Added versioned build-dep on debhelper >= 2.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue,  8 Apr 2003 02:59:57 -0500

cupsys (1.1.18-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Disable SSL again.  Inexplicably, the GNU TLS people put the
    OpenSSL compatibility layer under the GPL, not the LGPL.
    This forces the effective license on libcupsys2 to GPL, which
    I'm not comfortable with.  The urgency reflects possible
    license conflicts for apps that link to libcupsys2.
    Closes: #168056.
  * Add a debconf question to ask whether unrecognized
    application/octet-stream jobs should be printed as raw jobs.
  * Forward-port some of the security fixes from woody.
  * Set the default group for lppasswd to "lpadmin", in keeping
    with the default in cupsd.  Closes: #172842.

    to allow for easy upgrades.  Also added a Replaces entry for
    it.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Jan 2003 23:36:50 -0500

    include remote root exploits - thus the urgency.
  * Remove the conflict with manpages-fr per reports that the offending
    files are now all gone.  Closes: #158500.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Fri, 20 Dec 2002 03:27:18 -0500

cupsys (1.1.16-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation updates.
  * Change the GNU TLS patch to more explicitly control which SSL
    library is linked to, and support switching SSL libraries in
    the build.  By default, the package will not use OpenSSL, so
    autobuilders won't accidentally build it that way.
    Closes: #167489.
  * Add libgnutls-dev to the Dependencies for libcupsys2-dev.
  * Set the proper permissions on cupsys-client man pages.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat,  9 Nov 2002 16:39:54 -0500

  * Update clean target in debian/rules to clean a few more files
    that are missed by the Makefiles.
  * Remove SFont.cxx and T1Font.cxx from the pdftops Makefile;
    these two files aren't needed, and including them would pull
    in a build dep on xlibs-dev, which is bad news.  Closes: #166716.
  * Tell dh_installdocs to not mess with the postinst/prerm, so
    the compatibility symlinks aren't created.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 29 Oct 2002 00:45:38 -0500

cupsys (1.1.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add upstream patch to scheduler that fixes certain printer
    operations in the web interface.
  * Re-enabled SSL support using the OpenSSL compatibility library
    in libgnutls.  Closes: #150600.
  * Use our own logic for stopping/restarting cupsd on upgrade,
    instead of relying on dh_installinit.  Closes: #160345, #164435.
  * Make cupsys-client Recommend cupsys-bsd.  Closes: #157974.
  * Make sure we remove everything in /var/spool/cups on purge.
    Closes: #163571.

    of operation.

    need.  Closes: #166451.

    option.  Closes: #150819.
  * Make the switch to libpng3, now that woody is out.
    Closes: #156622.
  * It seemed that the rastertoepson filter occasionally lost its
    cookies under certain circumstances and passed NULL for a field.
    Cancel the pending job if that happens.  Closes: #147119.
  * Remove .cvsignore files.
  * Turned browsing back on by default.  With no BrowseAddresses set,
    no broadcast packets will go out, but cupsd will recognize and
    accept incoming packets.  Closes: #155574.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Aug 2002 15:51:45 -0500

cupsys (1.1.15-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reorganized the French man pages so they appear in the proper

  * Move lpinfo and lpmove utilities to cupsys-client, where they
    belong.
  * Added patch from upstream that fixes some problems with
    Orientation settings made by some PostScript generators.

cupsys (1.1.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Removed cupsys-pstoraster (since it's no longer provided in CUPS),
    and rely on gs-esp instead for its functionality.
  * Enabled SSL support and updated copyright file to reflect license
    change.  Closes: #150600.
  * Applied patch from upstream that causes the cupsd foreground
    process to wait until the daemon is ready before exiting.
    Also, changed init script to wait on the daemon before continuing.
    Closes: #150426.
  * Moved /etc/cups/certs to /var/spool/cups/certs.  Closes: #144887.
  * Split out German and Portugese debconf templates into separate
    files, and added French, Russian, and Spanish files.
    Closes: #137630, #138068, #142904.
  * Make cupsys Recommend smbclient, and handle symlinking smbspool
    to /usr/lib/cups/backend/smb if it's available.  Closes: #82690.
  * Make cupsys Suggest foomatic-bin for cupsomatic, so that
    linuxprinting.org PPDs work.  Closes: #146655.
  * Add examples/filters directory to cupsys and added the contributed
    DVI filter to it.  Users can copy the filter and config files into
    place themselves to get the functionality.  Closes: #55013, #136496.
  * Fixed a bug where "-" filters are rejected in some cases.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 29 Jul 2002 00:33:00 -0500

cupsys (1.1.14-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Remove all the stuff about setting the lpd backend setuid; per
    upstream, we don't need it anymore, and it's a security hole.

  * Fix man page references so, e.g., references go from backend(1) to
    cups-backend(1).  Closes: #126811.
  * Oops!  Debian has time_t->tm_gmtoff, which is defined to have the
    opposite sign of timezone.  Is it that way on BSD?  Anyway,
    reverse the sense of the sign for time_t->tm_gmtoff if we use
    that.  Closes: #126195.

    problems with implicit declaration on 64-bit systems.

cupsys (1.1.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move cups-lpd man page to cupsys-bsd.  Closes: #122311.
  * Oops!  Lost the patch to allow "cupsaccept", etc. commands.
    Closes: #123280.
  * Minor change to the init script output.  Closes: #121938.
  * Changed choose-uri.tmpl to be a little more clear.
    Closes: #117376.
  * Moved CUPS document root from /usr/share/doc/cupsys to
    /usr/share/cups/doc-root, and created a symlink from
    /u/s/d/cupsys/online-docs to it.  It turns out that serving
    files via CUPS from /usr/share/doc is a policy violation.
    Closes: #120923.
  * Fixed a small problem when upgrading from potato libcupsys1-dev
    to current libcupsys2-dev.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Dec 2001 00:58:41 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix libcupsys2 shlibs file to provide the proper dependency
    information.  Closes: #121405.
  * Oops!  Make sure SSL support isn't built yet.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Wed, 28 Nov 2001 11:41:17 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * It helps to run autoconf after making a change to the configure
    script. :-)  CXX=$CC change wasn't propagated, making the build
    fail on hppa.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Nov 2001 12:01:58 -0500

cupsys (1.1.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  Closes: #119162.
  * Updated Standards-Version.
  * Made cupsys depend on debconf.
  * Removed -Wl,rpath from config-scripts/cups-sharedlibs.m4.
  * Removed explicit libcupsys dep from cupsys.
  * Removed "CXX=$CC" from config-scripts/cups-compiler.m4.
  * Removed .SILENT from Makedefs so the build isn't silent anymore.
  * On devfs, look in /dev/printers as well as /dev/parallel.
    (Do we still need /dev/parallel?)  Closes: #114063.
  * Changed internal file: device URI type to test:, since (per
    upstream) it's not intended for anything other than to test
    filters.  See bug #115252 or README.Debian for more info.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Nov 2001 11:21:32 -0500

cupsys (1.1.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched cupsenable and cupsdisable symlinks to always point to
    /usr/sbin/accept to prevent them from breaking when files move
    around (as they did recently).  Closes: #114006.
  * It turns out that libcupsys needs to make temp files in
    /var/spool/cups/tmp, so that dir needs to be in the package.
    Closes: #115154.
  * Related to the above, when creating temp files, don't loop when
    the open fails unless the return value is EEXIST.  Thanks to Brian
    Ristuccia for the suggestion.
  * Honor the DEB_BUILD_OPTTIONS "debug" setting.
  * Per policy, make sure we build with -D_REENTRANT.
  * Don't remove /var/spool/cups in the cupsys postrm when purging.
  * Added German description to template.  Closes: #113604.
  * Added Portuguese description to cupsys-bsd template.
    Closes: #106131.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Oct 2001 23:07:34 -0500

cupsys (1.1.10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Scale back a bit on aggressiveness on purging cupsys, as it can
    cause us to remove the cupsys-client conffile.
  * It turns out that client.conf is parsed by libcupsys2, not
    cupsys-client, so it needs to switch packages.
  * Changed PAM code so it attempts to open the "cupsys" PAM config
    file, instead of the "cups" one.  Not sure how this broke again.
    Closes: #110651.
  * Per request, implemented the "reload" option in the init script.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Sep 2001 21:53:48 -0500

cupsys (1.1.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Conflicts: on cupsys-pstoraster with older cupsys packages
    because of moved files.  Closes: #106107.
  * Fixed bug concerning update-inetd handling; it was removing the
    inetd entry for the lpd server in cupsys-bsd with every upgrade.
    Closes: #109298.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Aug 2001 23:14:08 -0500

    upstream).
  * Fixed lpadmin group creation so NIS-style lpadmin group is
    recognized.  Closes: #78895, #107744.
  * Replaced kups with kdelibs3-cups in Suggests: lines, and
    reorganized Suggests line.  Closes: #109695.
  * Moved Suggests for all add-on clients to cupsys-client.
  * Fixed purge so /etc/cups is completely cleaned out.
    Closes: #108488.
  * Moved filter and backend man pages to cups-filter and
    cups-backend to avoid conflicts with other packages.
    Closes: #107629.
  * Made the lpd backend non-setuid, and created a low-priority
    debconf question to handle the few who really need it setuid.
    Closes: #77617.
  * Altered cupsys-bsd postinst; always remove any inetd lines when
    removing the package (we'll put it back later if we're just
    upgrading).

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Aug 2001 00:43:36 -0500

cupsys (1.1.9-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

    pointing to libcupsys2 anyways (Closes: #94504)
  * Removed maintainer postinst and prerm scripts from cupsys-client
    and libcupsys2-dev, by purging either of them you would have
    removed your cups documentation.
  * added German translation of debconf template to cupsys-bsd
    by Sebastian Feltel (Closes: #101467, #100901)
  * changed rm -f to rm -rf from cupsys-bsd prerm, and removed the link
    handling for /usr/doc, let debhelper worry about that.

cupsys (1.1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed PAM module name confusion (closes bugs #76457, #77114).
  * Fixed broken deps w.r.t. cupsys-client Replacing older cupsys
    versions (closes bug #75241).
  * Fixed broken deps surrounding cupsys-dev (closes bug #75242).
  * My shlibs file was badly broken; it referred to the cupsys package
    instead of the libcupsys2 package (closes bug #78485).
  * Fixed problem with upgrading; --oknodo wasn't passed to
    start-stop-daemon, causing the prerm to fail if cupsd wasn't running
    (closes bug #70698).

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Dec 2000 22:45:29 -0500

cupsys (1.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix misconfiguration in default config; cupsd now refuses connections
    to printers and printer classes from all hosts except localhost by
    default.  The previous default was to allow all hosts to connect to
    all printers - not a terribly secure default. :-)

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:55:48 -0500

cupsys (1.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

cupsys (1.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-add ppd directory to build (when did it drop out?) (closes bug

cupsys (1.1.0-0b3d1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Daemon 'cups-lpd' (new to this version) added to cupsys-bsd, with
    appropriate update-inetd calls, so cupsys-bsd is now a complete
    replacement for lpr.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 14 May 2000 00:08:23 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-8) stable; urgency=high

  * Security fix: the default configuration now no longer allows people
    to connect to printers except from localhost.  The previous default
    configuration allowed anyone to connect to any printer from any
    location; not a smart security move.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Nov 2000 00:37:06 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-7) frozen unstable; urgency=high

  * Additional DoS fixes, included in Easy Software Products' patch for
    the bug below.  As these are DoS bugs, I HIGHLY recommend including
    this in potato.

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sun, 18 Jun 2000 22:39:01 -0500

cupsys (1.0.4-6) frozen unstable; urgency=high

cupsys (1.0.4-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Makefile in conf was attempting to remove /etc/printcap during build, and
    fails to build if this fails (which it will under fakeroot); disabled
    this.  Closes bug #60455 (severity: important).

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Mar 2000 12:34:20 -0600

cupsys (1.0.4-3) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved /var/lib/cups/ppd/* config files (printer definitions) to
    /etc/cups/ppd (closes bug #59263).
  * Fixed shlibs for libcupsys1 (erroneous information) preventing
    packages that link to it from depending properly.
  * Changed default for browsing to Off to keep cupsd from probing the
    local network continuously (closes bug #59277).

 -- Jeff Licquia <licquia@debian.org>  Sat,  4 Mar 2000 18:23:01 -0600

cupsys (1.0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added quick hack to allow for -h option to lp (closes bug #52050).
  * Set the lpd backend suid after quick audit; it doesn't appear to have
    any egregious errors (closes part of bug #52381).
  * Move /var/lib/cups/conf files to /etc/cups, with a symlink in place of
    the old location (closes bug #52318).
  * Added "Authentication failed" message when authorizing after the first
    auth failure (which is likely before the first password request)
    (closes rest of bug #50264).
  * Made cupsys-bsd doc dir a symlink to the cupsys doc files, per policy
    section 6.6 (closes bug #51958).
  * Symlinked /var/lib/cups/logs to /var/log/cups (closes bug #51957).

cupsys (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Conflict with lprng, since lprng includes some SysV printing commands
    (closes bug #50539).
  * Added "cupsenable", "cupsdisable", "cupsaccept", and "cupsreject"
    commands as part of an ongoing effort to reduce namespace pollution.
    (addresses part of bug #50661 and #50384)
  * Set both the default user and group to "lp" (for permissions fixes).
  * Created "lpadmin" group and set SystemGroup to this.  This will
    fix problems with CUPS not being usable initially.  As soon as
    bug #50620 gets fixed, I'll set up to add root to the group, which
    will make root able to configure CUPS immediately after installation.

cupsys (1.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

cupsys (1.0.1-2) unstable; urgency=low
