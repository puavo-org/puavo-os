_Description: Do you want CUPS to print unknown jobs as raw jobs?
 The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) enforces a MIME type for all
 print jobs. Since not all sources of print jobs can attach an
 appropriate type, many jobs get submitted as the MIME type
 application/octet-stream and could be rejected if CUPS cannot guess
 the job's format.
 .
 CUPS can handle all such jobs as "raw" jobs, which causes them to be
 sent directly to the printer without processing.
 .
 It is recommended to choose this option if the server will be
 accepting print jobs from Windows computers or Samba servers.

_Description: Printer communication backends:
 CUPS uses backend programs to communicate with the printer device or port.
 .
 Please choose the backend program to be used by CUPS. The default choice
 should fit the most common environments.
