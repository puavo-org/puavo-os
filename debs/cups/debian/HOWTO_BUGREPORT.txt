Debian users,

For making clear your printing problem, I need some information.

1. Please describe your CUPS version/revision. This will be written
   automatically if you use Debian bug system tools.
2. Please describe Your printer vendor and model, and how to connect (usb,
   parallel, serial, lpd, ipp, http, socket, smb).
3. Please attach your /etc/cups/printers.conf (only about problematic printer)
4. Set LogLeveld as "debug" in your /etc/cups/cupsd.conf and reload by
   /etc/init.d/cups reload. After you do something causes a problem,
   please attach gzippped your /var/log/cups/error_log.
5. Please attach gzipped PPD file in /etc/cups/ppd/.

Before you report...
1. If you use gs as filter, please check /usr/bin/gs indicates gs-esp.
   gs-gnu doesn't support some drivers. If gs indicates gs-gnu, please
   change by 'update-alternatives --config gs'.
2. Please don't set severity to 'grave' or 'critical' if you couldn't success
   to print out. I usually test by my printer, then upload. (it means at
   least I can success to print out) 
   I promise to look over your report. Please use 'important' for
   "I can't print out by my printer!".

Thanks,
