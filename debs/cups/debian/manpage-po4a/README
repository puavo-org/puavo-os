# README for CUPS manpages translation

As the manpage translations patch using po4a has not been accepted by
upstream, they have been moved out of the patch to the
debian/manpage-po4a/ directory. This should ease shared maintenance and
enhance the visibility of these translations.

## How to update .pot and .po files

1. Checkout the branch you want to work on (usually 'debian/master').
   It has the patches already applied.

2. Launch po4a from the correct directory:

	$ cd man; po4a ../debian/manpage-po4a/cups.cfg
