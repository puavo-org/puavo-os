cups (1.6.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  From cups 1.6 the default IPP version for requests is 2.0. For remote
  connections configured with ServerName in /etc/cups/cups-client.conf,
  an older IPP version such as 1.1 or even 1.0 might need to be
  explicitly set for printing to keep working. For example:

    ServerName remote-print-server.example.com/version=1.1
