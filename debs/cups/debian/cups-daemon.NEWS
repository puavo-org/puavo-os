cups (2.4.2-3+deb12u2) bookworm; urgency=medium

  This release addresses a security issue (CVE-2023-32360) which allows
  unauthorized users to fetch documents over local or remote networks.
  Since this is a configuration fix, it might be that it does not reach you if you
  are updating 'cups-daemon' (rather than doing a fresh installation).
  Please double check your /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file, whether it limits the access
  to CUPS-Get-Document with something like the following
  >  <Limit CUPS-Get-Document>
  >    AuthType Default
  >    Require user @OWNER @SYSTEM
  >    Order deny,allow
  >   </Limit>
  (The important line is the 'AuthType Default' in this section)

cups (2.1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The default ErrorPolicy is changed from 'stop-printer' to 'retry-job',
  as this is a much less confusing default in most use-cases.

  The ErrorPolicy can be set globally in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf or
  per-printer, using the following command:
      lpadmin -p printername -o printer-error-policy=stop-printer

cups (1.7.5-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  CUPS can now be socket-activated when running under systemd as init, but
  isn't by default; if configured to do so, it can automatically exit itself
  after being idle for some time (30 seconds by default) by using the
  'SystemdIdleExit on' stanza in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.
