  * Notes on update plan:
    I have been extremely busy this semester at university, which means
    the packaging effort has fallen behind more than anticipated. However,
    as I did not complete my planned changes to the packaging yet, I'll
    continue to do one release at a time for a few days, improving the
    packaging incrementally to ensure everything works, with the aim of
    being done with the changes by the time I get to the 1.2 release
    (after all, it is supposed to be the stable release that might end
    up in a Debian release). Once I'm reasonably happy with the final
    packaging used for 1.2, I might consider fast-forwarding the 1.3
    releases to whatever the most recent release is.

wine-unstable (1.1.35-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.35, released Dec 18, 2009.
    - Support for OLE transacted storage.
    - Better certificate checking on secure connections.
    - More progress on the 16-bit separation.
    - Left 4 Dead 2 DRM really supported now.
    - MSI performance improvements.
    - 64-bit fixes in debugger support.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Made the wine-bin package use the alternatives system for binaries in
    /usr/bin. If both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Wine are installed,
    then the system will prefer the 64-bit version. If both stable and
    unstable versions of Wine are installed, then the system will prefer
    the stable version. As with other alternatives, the user can pick a
    different version with "update-alternatives --config wine" (or maybe
    invoke the desired binary directly, to the extent that works).

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 22 Aug 2011 02:14:28 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.34-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.34, released Dec 4, 2009.
    - Many fixes for crypto certificates support.
    - A lot of MSHTML improvements.
    - Various fixes to support the Left 4 Dead 2 DRM.
    - A number of OLE marshalling fixes.
    - More Listview improvements.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Added build-dependency alternative libjpeg8-dev.
  * If building in full-multiarch mode, make libwine Pre-Depend on
    multiarch-support. (But though this mode might work now, it is
    probably still too soon to make this the default.)
  * Better fix for lintian override paths (doesn't break multiarch paths).
  * Made debian/doclink.sh idempotent.
  * Fixed incorrect destination path in install-arch64 rule.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 14 Aug 2011 20:14:25 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.33-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.33, released Nov 13, 2009.
    - Gecko now installed at wineprefix creation time.
    - Better support for certificates in crypt32.
    - Improved sound support in mciwave.
    - Some more Direct3D 10 functions.
    - Many cleanups for issues spotted by Valgrind.

    handler for .exe files.
  * Add proper package suffixes to the installed reportbug control files.
  * On amd64, build-depend on ia32-libs-dev. Closes: #618224.

wine-unstable (1.1.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.32, released Oct 23, 2009.
    - Many crypto fixes, particularly on 64-bit.
    - Improved DVD access on Mac OS.
    - Several common controls improvements.
    - Various HTML support improvements.
    - More DIB optimizations.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Installed the new extrac32.exe utility into libwine-bin.
  * Install upstream's wine.desktop instead of maintaining our own
    (these days, their version is not as bad as it used to be).
  * Patched libs/wine/Makefile.in to make it possible to add a suffix
    to the name of libwine.so.
  * The suffix given to the package names is now also given to
    libwine.so. (This is intended as a step towards making libwine and
    libwine-unstable coinstallable.)
  * Replaced $(libdir)/wine with $(dlldir) in libs/wine/Makefile.in.
  * The suffix given to the package names is now also given to
    /usr/lib/wine.
  * Patched makefiles to make it possible to add a suffix to the name
    of /usr/share/wine.
  * The suffix given to the package names is now also given to
    /usr/share/wine.
  * Substitute the correct package name (with suffix) into the lintian
    overrides.
  * Override lintian error usr-share-doc-symlink-without-dependency,
    reported on packages wine and wine-bin. (The dependency isn't
    missing, these packages just depend on libwine through other
    libwine-* packages. I did not want to add redundant dependencies for
    lintian's sake, so I've added overrides instead.)

wine-unstable (1.1.31-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Performance improvements for DIB sections.
    - Several sound driver fixes.
    - Beginning of ActiveX support in JScript.
    - More Direct3D 10 work.
    - More 16-bit dlls split off to separate modules.
    - Support for attachments in MAPI.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Set the WINELOADER environment variable in the wine wrapper script,
    to ensure the debugger finds the expected binary. Closes: #549088.
  * Wrapper script output is now directed to stderr. Closes: #543709.

    - Support for OpenAL.
    - Many improvements in HTML and JavaScript support.
    - Many common controls fixes and improvements.
    - More Direct3D 10 work.
    - Better MAPI support.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Installed openal32.dll into the new libwine-openal package.
    Added libopenal-dev build-dependency.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 18 Oct 2009 19:08:25 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.29, released Sep 2, 2009.
    - Improved Gecko integration by using Wine's network layers.
    - Use of external libmpg123 for mp3 decoding.
    - Support for JPEG and PNG formats in WindowsCodecs.
    - Many regression test fixes for Win64 and Windows 7.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Added libmpg123-dev to Build-Depends, and made libwine recommend the
    corresponding library.
  * Installed the new dxdiag.exe application into libwine-bin.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 04 Oct 2009 15:27:56 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.28-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.28, released Aug 21, 2009.
    - Support for IRDA protocol.
    - Faster initial wineprefix creation.
    - Axis remapping with evdev joysticks.
    - More image formats in WindowsCodecs.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * On amd64, check for libnss_mdns4.so.2 in /usr/lib32 instead of in
    /lib32. (Apparently it was placed in /usr/lib32 by a NMU that didn't
    try to match the old directory layout as much as I had assumed, and
    that it probably should have.) (Closes: #541201)
  * Changed XB-Multi-Arch to Multi-Arch in debian/control. (By the time
    the field actually matters, dpkg-dev will probably support it.)
  * Only include the Multi-Arch annotations in the packages when
    building in full-multiarch mode, in which the amd64 Wine packages
    will not include 32-bit Wine. This mode is, of course, not enabled
    by default yet.
  * Added ${shlibs:Depends} to libwine-dev's Depends field. The shlibs-
    added dependencies for this package are redundant, but can't hurt,
    and it suppresses a warning.
  * Install the new pre-built fake DLLs into the Wine packages,
    following the package split. To reduce future problems, I now use
    *.install-modules files to list all DLLs to install, and then
    prep-install.sh makes sure all files relevant to that DLL get
    properly installed.
  * If 32-bit Wine is compiled on amd64 using multiarch paths, depend on
    a libc6-i386 >= 2.9-24.
  * With ia32-apt-get gone, and multiarch paths only working on sid
    (hence making my backports probably not work), switch back to
    traditional library paths for now, to see if the package still works
    with them. Also closes: #540706.
  * Made sure the *.install-common files aren't empty, or they don't end
    up in the diff, which would confuse the current build system
    (perhaps I should fix that someday, but...)

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 22 Aug 2009 19:43:44 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.27, released Aug 7, 2009.
    - New version of the Gecko engine.
    - New GSM 06.10 codec support.
    - Improved support for the disk volume APIs.
    - Support for XShm pixmaps for better performance.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Added libgsm1-dev build-dependency.
  * Added wineconsole and wine-safe manpages by Francois Wendling.
    (Closes: #540652, #540653)
  * Annotate binary packages with the Multi-Arch field as appropriate.
  * Added a script to generate Recommends lines. Initially use it to
    make libwine recommend the libgsm package Wine was compiled against.
    (The package splitting has gone far enough, I don't think I want to
    make a separate libwine-codecs package to depend on libgsm. I'm just
    going to use Recommends instead for stuff like that. Perhaps even
    eliminate some more libwine-* packages in the future...)
  * Made it possible to add suffixes to the dependencies of
    autogenerated transition packages. (I've used this to make
    experimental users migrate to the wine-unstable packages.)
  * Automatically substitute the current library paths into the lintian
    overrides.
  * Added lintian override for wine.bin being unstripped.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 09 Aug 2009 15:29:11 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.26-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.26, released Jul 17, 2009.
    - Still more translation updates.
    - Faster bitmap stretching using XRender.
    - Proxy support in WinHTTP.
    - Many more JScript functions.
    - Various bug fixes.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 18 Jul 2009 21:16:14 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.25-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.25, released Jul 3, 2009.
    - A ton of translation updates.
    - Support for various Unicode file encodings in Notepad.
    - Improved memory management, especially for OpenGL.
    - Desktop menus now cleaned up automatically.
    - Beginnings of a windowscodecs DLL implementation.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Split out yet another binary package, libwine-bin, which now
    contains everything wine-bin used to ship in /usr/lib/wine.
  * Moved all winelib programs in wine-utils to libwine-bin and wine-bin.
    Moved all development utilities in wine-utils to libwine-dev.
    Moved all remaining utilities in wine-utils to wine-bin.
    Deleted the wine-utils package.
  * Removed wine-utils from README.Debian.
  * Now build with multiarch library paths. Hence, instead of /usr/lib
    on i386 and /usr/lib32 on amd64, Wine's 32-bit libraries are now in
    /usr/lib/i486-linux-gnu for both. Although full multiarch isn't here
    yet, this should also make Wine work better with ia32-apt-get.
  * If installing into /usr/lib32 (on an amd64 system), and it is not a
    symlink on the build system, force the resulting binaries to pre-
    depend on libc6-i386 2.9.18. Closes: #535204.
  * Updated winelauncher for the new realities in the amd64 world. Any
    other fallout from the ia32-libs transitions is out of my control.
    (Closes: #535097)
  * Added code to generate transition packages for amd64 in the event
    that ia32-apt-get completely replaces ia32-libs. Not enabled yet,
    though, since right now, it looks like such a replacement may not
    actually happen.
  * Removed versioned dependency on ia32-libs.
  * In the scripts for preprocessing debhelper files to add package
    suffixes, also handle maintainer scripts and documentation.
  * Updated year in debian/copyright.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 11 Jul 2009 20:51:19 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.24, released Jun 19, 2009.
    - Support for freedesktop file associations.
    - Support for exception handling on 64-bit.
    - Improved ARB shaders.
    - Fixes for the FBO mode.
    - Many listview improvements.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Check at build time whether /usr/lib32 is a symlink (and what it
    symlinks to). It should then be a matter of a quick rebuild in the
    appropriate build environment to get packages that work both before
    and after the transition.
  * Name the upstream tarball properly in debian/maint/import (with
    -unstable for the 1.1.* series).

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 21 Jun 2009 19:30:18 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.23-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * On amd64, install into /emul/ia32-linux/usr/lib instead of into
    /usr/lib32. While they both refer to the same place, the relative
    paths inferred by the Wine build process work much better when
    they're deduced from the true path, rather than from symlinks.
  * Removed obsolete configure option --enable-opengl.
  * Changed "git-cat-file" to "git cat-file" in debian/maint/build-final.
  * Fixed git-dch workaround in debian/maint/build-final to work with
    package updates that aren't new upstream releases.
  * Exclude wine.bin from stripping, so that this will compile on lenny.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Fri, 19 Jun 2009 01:20:14 +0200

wine-unstable (1.1.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - FBO mode is now the default for Direct3D.
    - Support for COM proxy delegation.
    - Improved support for the Mingw cross-compile.
    - Proper fullscreen mode for the virtual desktop.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Add "-unstable" suffix to package names for the Wine development
    branch, and upload to sid.
  * Fix up package names of dependencies when adding a suffix. For now,
    also add conflicts with the corresponding suffixless packages.
  * Fix cleanup after building a package with a suffix and extra
    dependencies.

    - Beginnings of x86_64 exception handling.
    - Direct3D locking fixes.
    - ARB shaders improvements.
    - Better OpenGL pixel format support.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Added workaround to debian/maint/build-final for current git-dch not
    working like it's supposed to.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 10 Jun 2009 13:25:08 +0200

wine (1.1.21-1) experimental; urgency=low

    - Support for copying/pasting images from X11 applications.
    - A number of GDIPlus improvements.
    - Various listview fixes.
    - 64-bit support in winemaker.
    - Support for building on Mac OS X Snow Leopard.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Made it possible to easily add a suffix to all package names. This
    should make it possible to maintain multiple branches of Wine
    (stable and unstable) simply by specifying different suffixes.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 09 Jun 2009 23:38:43 +0200

wine (1.1.20-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.20, released Apr 24, 2009.
    - Show a dialog on application crashes.
    - Much improved OLE copy/paste support.
    - Various listview improvements.
    - More Direct3D code cleanups.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Killed the libwine-twain transitional package.
  * Renamed remaining debian/*.install files to debian/*.install-common.
  * Installed termsv.exe.so into wine-bin.
  * On amd64, winelib is now installed into /usr/lib32 instead of
    /usr/lib. (This *is* an upload to experimental, after all...)

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Mon, 01 Jun 2009 00:30:23 +0200

wine (1.1.19-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.19, released Apr 10, 2009.
    - Support for Visual C++ project files in winemaker.
    - Improvements to the Esound driver.
    - Many Direct3D code cleanups.
    - Fixes to OLE clipboard handling.
    - OpenBSD compilation fixed.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Made filenames in libwine.split tidier.
  * Split libwine-gphoto2 and libwine-sane with libwine.split instead of
    with *.install files.
  * Removed *.dirs files, rely on dh_install (and split.sh) to create
    directories as needed.
  * Made the /usr/share/doc/<package> directory in all binary packages
    (except libwine) be a symlink to /usr/share/doc/libwine. (All binary
    packages already do have a strict dependency on the same libwine
    binary version as themselves, so this should be in line with
    policy.) Since Debian Wine is made up of many binary packages, this
    should reduce the .deb package sizes and disk usage somewhat.
  * Merged fixes from lenny branch:
    - Recommend ttf-liberation, and changed msttcorefonts suggestion to
      ttf-mscorefonts-installer. Closes: #490861.
    - Removed application/x-zip-compressed from wine.desktop.
      Closes: #452957.

    - Improved support for upgrades in MSI.
    - Debug symbols in WineDbg on Mac OS X.
    - Many Direct3D code cleanups.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Changed section of libwine-dbg to the new "debug" section.
  * The logic for only installing binaries that are actually built is
    now in separate shell scripts (prep-install.sh, clean-install.sh).
  * Instead of splitting up libwine with a long list of "mv" commands in
    debian/rules, the list of files and packages to split into is now in
    a separate libwine.split file, which is processed by a shell script
    (split.sh).

    - Obsolete LinuxThreads support has been removed.
    - Many fixes to the regression tests on Windows.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * README.twain is no more, was removed upstream.
  * Permanently removed the amd64 binaries-in-diff hack.
  * Worked on the experimental 64-bit support in debian/rules a bit.
    Since gcc-4.4 is now in Debian, the 64-bit build rules will now use
    that. Properly packaging the result will take a bit more work,
    though...

wine (1.1.16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.16, released Feb 27, 2009.
    - Improved SANE scanner support.
    - Support for digital CD audio playback.
    - Improved cookies management in Wininet.
    - Support for building stand-alone 16-bit modules.
    - Many fixes to the regression tests on Windows.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Try to install *.vxd.so only if they were built. (Closes: #517886)
  * Changed "git-cat-file" to "git cat-file" in debian/maint/import.
  * Changed uninstaller.desktop to execute "wine uninstaller".
  * Wine no longer installs progman, uninstaller, and winebrowser as
    their own binaries. Thus, removed these from the packaging, along
    with their man pages. (The programs can still be run through the
    "wine" command, e.g. "wine uninstaller".)
  * Install stand-alone 16-bit modules (if they were built) into
    libwine.
  * Installed lodctr.exe.so, unlodctr.exe.so, and cacls.exe.so into
    wine-bin.

wine (1.1.15-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.15, released Feb 13, 2009.
    - Gecko engine update.
    - Better region support in GdiPlus.
    - Support for cross-compilation in winegcc.
    - Beginnings of MS Text Framework support.
    - Many fixes to the regression tests on Windows.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Added build-dependency alternative libjack-dev.

wine (1.1.14-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.14, released Jan 30, 2009.
    - Various bug fixes for Internet Explorer 7.
    - Many crypt32 improvements, including new export wizard.
    - Better support for windowless Richedit.
    - Improvements to the print dialog.
    - Many fixes to the regression tests on Windows.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Try to fix a PowerPC build failure (reported but not fixed upstream yet).

wine (1.1.13-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.13, released Jan 16, 2009.
    - Freedesktop.org-compliant startup notifications.
    - Many fixes for 64-bit application support.
    - Improved graphics support in Internet Explorer.
    - Various Richedit improvements.
    - Better certificate manager dialog.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Fix a minor copy&paste error I did for copying wine-preloader etc
    into the packages (should use install, not mv, in the binary-arch
    target).
  * Install control panel modules into wine-bin. (Currently there's only
    one - Add/Remove Programs.) (Closes: #511266)
  * Added a more general way to only install certain binaries into
    libwine if they were actually built; it now also works for wine-bin,
    where winevdm.exe.so is now in the list of optional binaries.
  * Installed clock.exe.so and icinfo.exe.so into the wine-utils
    package, for some kind of completeness's sake.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 17 Jan 2009 15:02:33 +0100

wine (1.1.12-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.12, released Jan 2, 2009.
    - Some simple 64-bit apps should now run.
    - Support for subpixel font rendering.
    - 64-bit code generation in the IDL compiler.
    - New version of the Gecko engine.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * I will note that Wine's 64-bit support requires gcc 4.4 features
    (and there's no gcc 4.4 in Debian yet). It's now possible to build
    64-bit Wine using gcc-snapshot, but packaging isn't possible yet.
    And anyway, there appears to not yet be any pre-made code to detect
    whether a particular .exe is 64-bit or 32-bit, and thus which
    Wine to run it with. (In a pinch, I suppose using "file" in the
    wrapper script would do the trick, though...)

    - Better support for MSI installation patches.
    - Various Direct3D optimizations.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Add dh_installman to debian/rules.
  * Added manpages written by Francois Wendling. (Closes: #284295,
    #284297, #284300, #284301, #284302, #284303, #284304, #284305,

    if they were built (basically only on i386 systems with glibc).
    Closes: #511077.

    - Support for virtual memory write watches.
    - Workarounds for the WINAPI compiler bug on Mac OS.
    - Several fixes for the 64-bit build.
    - Some more GdiPlus functions.

  * Comment out currently-unnecessary mensis invocation in debian/rules.
    Closes: #510762.
  * Removed unneeded dh_testroot from the clean-arch32/arch64 rules.

wine (1.1.9-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.1.9, released Nov 21, 2008.
    - A large number of regression test fixes.
    - Performance improvements in memory management.
    - Improved POP3 support in inetcomm.
    - Initial implementation of the XInput DLL.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Made the debian/maint/import script run date in the C locale.
  * Upstream added a --disable-tests configure option. Since the Debian
    packaging currently makes no use of the tests (the buildds probably
    couldn't run them anyway since they probably need an X display),
    I'll use this option, to shorten the build time a little bit.
  * Support the "parallel" option of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.8.0.
  * The wineshelllink script has been obsoleted. Thus, it's no longer
    packaged, and bugs about it no longer applies.

    - Beginnings of schannel implementation using GnuTLS.
    - Many fixes from various code analysis tools.
    - Support for X11 desktop work area.
    - Fixes for Richedit tables.
    - More complete JavaScript support.
    - Various bug fixes.
  * Added build-dependency alternatives libgl1-mesa-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev.
  * Removed fontforge from Build-Depends (for a while now, upstream has
    shipped pre-built fonts in the tarball, and they no longer build the
    fonts at compile time by default, in order to work around bugs in
    various fontforge versions).
  * Added libgnutls-dev to Build-Depends (why can't Wine settle with
    *either* OpenSSL *or* GnuTLS, instead of requiring both?)

  * New upstream release 1.0-rc5, released Jun 13, 2008.
    - Bug fixes only, we are in code freeze.
  * Updated dependencies to use the new CUPS package names.

wine (1.0-rc4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.0-rc4, released Jun 6, 2008.
    - Bug fixes only, we are in code freeze.
  * Moved hh.exe from wine-utils to wine-bin.
  * There's no longer an official upstream changelog file. It's possible
    to automatically generate one from their git repository, but
    probably not very important to do at this time. For now, I've
    removed all upstream changelogs from the packages.
  * Major update of README.Debian. Obsolete information has been
    removed, and what remains has been updated and expanded.

wine (1.0-rc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.0-rc2, released May 23, 2008.
    - Bug fixes only, we are in code freeze.

  [ Ove Kaaven ]
  * winhelp has been renamed to winhlp32, updated debian/wine-bin.install
    accordingly.
  * Reverted Debian modifications to tools/wineinstall, they won't be
    needed anymore.
  * Made libwine-oss depend on oss-compat.
  * debian/rules clean now depends unconditionally on clean-arch32 and
    clean-arch64. This should allow the clean rule to do its job even
    outside of a chroot.
  * Deleted debian/wine-utils.undocumented.
  * On amd64, symlink in libraries from ia32-libs for Wine to link
    against, to work around ia32-libs not providing the necessary
    symlinks itself. (Based on list of libraries provided by Arthur
    Loiret.)
  * Disable the old amd64 hack in favor of the new ia32-libs symlink
    hack.

  [ Arthur Loiret ]
  * Add myself to Uploaders.

wine (1.0-rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 1.0-rc1, released May 9, 2008.
    - Bug fixes only, we are in code freeze.
  * Made the pkg-wine-party mailing list the official maintainer of the
    Wine packages, and myself a mere uploader.
  * Moved libwine's Recommends on libwine-print and libwine-gl to a
    Suggests in wine-bin instead, since I've gotten reports from people
    not desiring of either component.
  * Fixed watch file for Wine "rc" release versions.
  * Reverted patch to mark stack executable. It hasn't been doing
    anything for a while (the functional part of it probably got lost in
    a merge conflict), and nobody has complained, so it's probably not
    needed anymore.
  * Did some fixes to the debian/maint/* scripts.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 10 May 2008 10:14:53 +0200

wine (0.9.61-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Seems ia32-libs is not in shape yet after all. Re-enabled amd64
    hack.
  * Made debian/diff-amd64.sh handle the new SHA checksums.
  * Improved debian/maint/build-final's generation of changelogs for
    Debian revisions.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 06 May 2008 07:13:23 +0200

wine (0.9.61-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.61, released May 2, 2008.
    - Automatic updating of the WINEPREFIX directory.
    - Winhelp now uses Richedit as display engine.
    - Many RichEdit fixes.
    - More improvements to IME support.
    - More quartz fixes.
    - Implementation for many more Gdiplus functions.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Added Vcs-* fields to debian/control, pointing at the new Git
    repository for the Debian Wine packages.
  * Fix diff-amd64.sh to work if building out of the Git repository.
  * Allow clean rule to succeed if invoked more than once with
    DEB_SAVEBUILD set.
  * Added scripts to import new upstream releases and build packages
    using the pkg-wine Git repository.
  * Added debian/watch file.
  * With ia32-libs version 2.4, it's finally possible to build Wine
    properly on amd64, so I'll now finally disable the amd64 hack.
    (Closes: #381341.)

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 03 May 2008 07:46:16 +0200

wine (0.9.60-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added the lpr virtual package as an alternative dependency for
    cupsys-bsd in the libwine-print package. I probably should have
    done that in the first place, but wasn't sure it made sense...
    Closes: #478053.
  * Changed debian/rules to make building and using amd64.tar.lzma.uu
    a bit more tweakable (and possible to turn off easily). I'm not
    totally sure how I should handle backports, given that ia32-libs
    in etch probably lacks a lot of stuff, but there's now commented-out
    code to automatically delete amd64.tar.lzma.uu if building on stable.
    Perhaps the opposite makes more sense?
  * Set urgency to medium, as all the bugfixes in 0.9.60 are eagerly
    awaited by many testing users, and all these debian revisions
    have stalled migration long enough, I guess.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 26 Apr 2008 18:31:20 +0200

wine (0.9.60-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Just noticed that I broke the amd64 build (again) by trying
    to install the new winelauncher into a directory that was only
    created by a regular build, not by the amd64 hack.
    Added a mkdir to hopefully fix it again.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Wed, 23 Apr 2008 02:53:56 +0200

wine (0.9.60-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made libwine-print depend on cupsys-bsd. Closes: #475138.
  * Made debian/winelauncher use dpkg --print-architecture instead
    of uname -m.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Tue, 22 Apr 2008 13:33:13 +0200

wine (0.9.60-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.60.
    - Better support for Windows IMEs.
    - Option for Windows-style window decorations.
    - Improved system tray behavior.
    - Window management fixes.
    - Improved quartz audio support.
    - Better support for launching apps from Unix file managers.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Apr 18, 2008.
  * The winelauncher is removed upstream, so its flaws won't be
    bothering anyone anymore. Closes: #464166, #321470.
  * However, I've been too lazy to change the way I do wine-safe
    and wine-auto, so I took the code I used to patch the old
    winelauncher with, and put it into debian/winelauncher. So
    there's still a wrapper script, but it doesn't do any of the
    old winelauncher magic. It just does two things now:
    * if Wine is launched from mailcap, it asks for confirmation,
      like before.
    * plus, I made it check if it's running on amd64, and if so,
      check if the user has a broken libnss-mdns configuration.
      If so, it tells them to fix it.
  * The bug_report.pl script is also removed upstream, so it's
    also no longer in the wine-bin package.
  * Removed the --ignore-missing-info again.
  * Added a couple of hooks for reportbug, so the libwine dependencies
    are included if people file bugs on wine or wine-bin.
  * Renamed font_convert.sh in wine-utils to wine-font-convert,
    to comply with new Policy 3.7.0 guideline of not including
    script extension.
  * Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.7.3.
  * Added dh_desktop call to debian/rules.
  * Added a couple of lintian overrides for libwine. The package isn't
    lintian clean, I just added what I'm sure should be overridden.

wine (0.9.59-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.59.
    - Improved support for the .NET framework.
    - Better services handling through a separate services.exe process.
    - Support for ATI fragment shader.
    - Better support for http proxies.
    - Window management fixes.
    - Pre-compiled fonts are now available in the source tree.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Apr 4, 2008.
  * Installed reg.exe.so and services.exe.so into wine-bin.
  * Made libwine-capi priority extra, since the package it depends on,
    libcapi20, is also priority extra.
  * Re-added #DEBHELPER# token to libwine.postinst and wine.postinst
    (probably got lost when I tried to get rid of the debconf templates).
  * Removed empty directory /usr/share/applications from wine-utils.
  * Removed empty directory /usr/lib/wine from dummy package libwine-twain.
  * Changed the architectures of the libasound2-dev build-dependency to
    match the architectures of the libwine-alsa package.
  * Changed the architectures of the libcapi20-dev build-dependency to
    match the architectures of the libwine-capi package.
  * Only build-depend on prelink on i386 and amd64. It's not available on
    most architectures, after all. Hopefully no big deal for the rest.

wine (0.9.58-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.58.
    - The default version is now Windows XP.
    - Many Richedit improvements.
    - Beginning of jscript dll support.
    - Shell folders now respect XDG directory configuration.
    - Many translation updates.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Mar 21, 2008.
  * Fixed the install-arch*-stamp rules which I added to debian/rules
    in my previous upload, so they now work on more than my own machine.
    Closes: #472650.
  * Added --ignore-missing-info to the dh_shlibdeps in debian/rules,
    to see if it might work around the broken ia32-libs package that
    the Debian amd64 port is currently suffering from. (Suggested by
    Robert Millan.)

wine (0.9.57-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.57.
    - Support for multiple OpenGL pixel formats.
    - Improved support for color profiles.
    - Many window management fixes.
    - Better fullscreen support.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Mar 7, 2008.
  * Added --list-missing option to the dh_install invocation.
  * Installed the translated wine and wineserver man pages.
  * Installed *.mod16 and *.sys.so (i.e., winoldap.mod16 and mountmgr.sys.so)
    into libwine.
  * Installed secedit.exe, svchost.exe, and write.exe into wine-bin.
  * Delete marlett.ttf~ (a backup file created by the workaround I currently
    use for a fontforge bug)
  * Removed empty directories /etc and /usr/share/man/man5 from wine-bin.
  * The install-arch* rules (in debian/rules) now uses install-arch*-stamp
    to remember if they're already complete, so binary-arch can be rerun
    (for testing purposes) without having to wait for install-arch.

    - Proper handling of OpenGL/Direct3D windows with menu bars.
    - Stubs for all the d3dx9_xx dlls.
    - Several graphics optimizations.
    - Many installer fixes.
    - Improved MIME message support.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Feb 22, 2008.
  * Added kfreebsd-amd64 to Architecture fields in debian/control.
  * On amd64 architectures, libwine-dev now also depends on libc6-dev-i386.
  * Force libwine to depend on libhal, libssl, libXcursor, libXi, libXrandr,
    and libXinerama.
    While the upstream Wine developers probably don't like the way I handle
    dependencies much, I believe that my dependency system might be quite
    useful on amd64 in the future, when users won't necessarily have the
    necessary 32-bit libraries installed even when the regular 64-bit
    libraries are installed and configured. And then they would be like,
    "why doesn't ALSA sound work in Wine?!?!!111one1", "why can't I
    print???", or "why won't it load SSL? I've installed it!"
  * Force libwine-gl to depend on libXcomposite.
    Technically, Xcomposite is loaded from x11drv, which is in libwine,
    not libwine-gl, but I believe Xcomposite is only actually used for
    offscreen rendering surfaces for 3D applications, so it seems
    appropriate that libwine-gl pulls it in.
  * Force wine-bin to depend on ncurses.
    I'm not sure how useful this is. It's only used by wineconsole if
    you specifically request ncurses-mode, and ncurses-mode is currently
    broken. But then again, why not? It's just ncurses. Everybody has it.
  * Added --noinhibit-exec linker option to debian/gendeps.sh, just in
    case. Should hopefully ensure that even if not all build dependencies
    are available at build time, at least information about those that
    are will get into the built binary packages.
  * Moved the d3dx9 dlls to libwine-gl.
  * Added Homepage field to debian/control.
  * Added libwine-oss to package list in README.Debian, and slightly
    clarified what the metapackage does.

wine (0.9.55-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.55.
    - Direct3D improvements, including driver version emulation.
    - Beginnings of support for OLE objects in Richedit.
    - Several fixes to the animation control.
    - A bunch of fixes for regression test failures.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Feb 8, 2008.
  * Added lib32z1-dev build-dependency for amd64. This is not strictly
    correct, since Wine does not itself depend on zlib. However, some
    libraries in ia32-libs (such as freetype) do, and since there's no
    ia32-libs-dev package which might be able to depend on -dev packages,
    there's not really any other place to work around this for now.
    Hopefully they'll fix that soon...

wine (0.9.54-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.54.
    - Photoshop CS/CS2 should now work, please help us testing it.
      See http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobePhotoshop for details.
    - A number of RPC fixes.
    - Various improvements to the debugger support.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Jan 25, 2008.
  * Added unixodbc-dev to Build-Depends. Along with the new upstream
    check for libodbc soname from Wine 0.9.53, this should make
    Wine able to find unixodbc without the need for symlinks or
    environment variables. Closes: #259710.
  * Removed libungif4-dev from Build-Depends. In Wine 0.9.21, they
    copied the ungif source files they needed into the Wine source code
    itself, so an external ungif isn't needed anymore.
  * Installed README.Debian into wine-bin and libwine.
  * Fixed spelling error in wine-safe message (intented => intended).
  * Patched winelauncher to allow the user to override WINEDLLPATH
    WINESERVER, and WINELOADER. Closes: #323198.
  * Patched winelauncher to only redirect stderr to the debug log,
    not stdout. This should allow stdout to be independently
    redirected by the user even while capturing a log. (This was
    accomplished with bashisms, so winelauncher's interpreter is
    no longer /bin/sh, it's now explicitly /bin/bash.)
  * Commented out the echo "Wine exited with a successful status"
    line in winelauncher. It was a bit annoying and unnecessary...

wine (0.9.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.53.
    - RunOnce and Run entries now executed on startup.
    - Beginnings of support for emulated disk devices.
    - Many Richedit improvements.
    - Nicer looking color dialog.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Jan 11, 2008.
  * Moved wined3d.dll.so from libwine-gl to libwine, since it no
    longer depends on OpenGL, and now implements DirectDraw 2D operations.
    Closes: #458804.
  * Removed libwine's Conflicts/Replaces of libwine0.0.971116, that's
    clearly very, very, old.
  * The wine metapackage now Suggests winbind. Closes: #452617.
  * Made debian/rules run a Mensis script to correct wrong codepage ranges
    embedded in marlett.ttf, to work around fontforge bug #458234, so
    Debian users without msttcorefonts installed can get legible text
    (in most cases).
  * Re-added some debconf stuff (dh_installdebconf, load debconf in postinst,
    a few *.config files), so that users will be able to purge out old
    debconf templates. Although debconf does not provide a reasonable way
    to clean out old templates after a package has been reorganized, I put
    db_purge into all the relevant postinsts, at least; let's hope that it
    works good enough for an upgrade from etch, and that it allows me to
    remove debconf permanently after lenny or so. Closes: #443429.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 12 Jan 2008 02:52:06 +0100

wine (0.9.52-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch to Wine package descriptions from
    debian-l10n-english team. Closes: #442952.
  * Create /usr/share/doc/wine-bin instead of /usr/share/doc/wine
    in the wine-bin package. Closes: #458171.
  * Make wine-bin depend on x11-utils as an alternative to the obsolete
    xbase-clients. Closes: #458341.
  * Upgraded debhelper compatibility level to 5.
    Also meant I had to remove some /usr/lib/* cruft from debian/*.install,
    since there aren't many files not in /usr/lib/wine these days...
  * Changed the -l argument of dh_shlibdeps to point to the "installed"
    libraries in debian/libwine/usr/lib, rather than pointing into the
    build tree.
  * Depend on dh_shlibdeps to generate the correct libwine dependencies
    instead of specifying them manually in debian/control; this eliminates
    duplicate dependencies. To get the proper versioned dependencies I want,
    I call dh_makeshlibs twice, once before dh_shlibdeps (with an
    exact-versioned dependency), and once after, with a more relaxed
    dependency, for everyone else that might be using libwine.
    Closes: #381301.
  * Created libwine-dbg package, using dh_strip's --dbg-package feature.
    Since the objcopy used for this barfs on the loader binaries
    (wine-kthread, wine-pthread), causing dh_strip to abort the build,
    I have to exclude these binaries from being stripped, unfortunately.

wine (0.9.52-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.52.
    - Improved graphics tablet support.
    - Support for RPC context handles.
    - Fixes for some longstanding screen depth issues.
    - Implementation of "My Network Places" shell folder.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Dec 28, 2007.
  * Add build-dependency alternative for gcc-multilib for backports.
    Closes: #458011.
  * No longer build-depend on old flex versions, I think they fixed
    the incompatibilities with new flex versions a while ago.
  * Applied tools/c2man.pl patch from Roderich Schupp so that perl 5.10
    doesn't barf on it. Closes: #457943. (Should probably be propagated
    upstream, but I'm a little lazy. Someone already submitted a patch
    to them long ago anyway, not my fault they didn't apply it already.
    They'll get around to it once they upgrade their distros, I guess...)

wine (0.9.51-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * On amd64, Build-Depend on gcc-multilib instead of libc6-dev-i386.
    Closes: #457557.
  * Changed debian/gendeps.sh and debian/cleandeps.sh to always
    return success, so the package will build even if not all
    the expected dependencies are available to link against
    (typically the case on amd64).
  * debian/gendeps.sh is now able to build for 32-bit or 64-bit,
    as specified on its command line; debian/rules now invokes it
    as appropriate for the target architecture.
  * The build-indep rule no longer depends on a configure rule. There's
    currently no architecture-independent stuff to build, after all.
  * Removed dh_undocumented from debian/rules, and a few other
    minor cleanups.
  * Removed unnecessary whitespace from ifeq/ifneq conditions in
    debian/rules, in case it matters on some systems.

    - Better Japanese font support.
    - A ton of rpcrt4 fixes.
    - Several Alsa capture fixes.
    - Improved support for screen resolution changes.
    - Lots of bug fixes.

wine (0.9.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.50.
    - Completed I/O completion.
    - Improved user credentials management, including Mac Keychain support.
    - More Valgrinding.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Nov 30, 2007.
  * Apparently I'd put winecfg.desktop into wine-utils by mistake.
    Moved it to wine-bin.
  * Also moved cmd, iexplore, net, uninstaller, winepath, winhelp, and
    xcopy from wine-utils to wine-bin. There are three types of Wine
    programs: "essential", "useful to most", and "not useful to most".
    Where clearly the first category should go into wine-bin, and the last
    into wine-utils, previously I've also put much from the middle category
    into wine-utils. I'm thinking I should perhaps put that into wine-bin
    instead, to make wine-utils a little more useless, and hence, the
    package split a little more useful.

wine (0.9.49-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * When creating the diff to update the source package, suppress
    the timestamps. Closes: #456422.
  * Change the Recommends on msttcorefonts to Suggests.
    Closes: #360610.
  * Add Build-Depends for libpng12-dev and libxcomposite-dev.
  * Replaced the debian/rules hacks that I've used to e.g. force
    libwine-print to depend on cups and stuff with a more general
    mechanism, where I can put libraries I want packages to depend
    on into <package>.deps files, and then arrange for dh_shlibdeps
    to determine the appropriate dependency, by having a shell
    script compile some dummy executables before invoking it.
  * Decided to remove libwine-capi dependency from wine metapackage.
  * Removed mention of libwine-arts from README.Debian, since it
    no longer exists.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sun, 16 Dec 2007 04:38:26 +0100

wine (0.9.49-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.49.
    - Many copy protection fixes.
    - GLSL is now the default for Direct3D.
    - Lots of memory errors fixed thanks to Valgrind.
    - Support for TOPMOST windows.
    - Beginnings of an inetcomm dll implementation.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Nov 9, 2007.
  * Added debian/tmp to all file paths in debian/*.install,
    so I don't have to use dh_install's --sourcedir anymore.
    Tweaked things a bit so almost everything I'm including
    in the packaging is installed with dh_install instead of
    with "install"/"cp" commands in debian/rules.
  * On amd64, no longer explicitly add dependencies on libfreetype6,
    libcupsys2, and libjack0.100.0-0; after all, wine needs the 32-bit
    libraries in ia32-libs, not these 64-bit ones.
  * Also moved the generation of the amd64.tar.lzma.uu further up in the
    build process, before the dh_makeshlibs/dh_installdeb/dh_shlibdeps,
    so that maintainer scripts and dependencies should be generated a bit
    more like they would if the binaries were compiled directly on amd64.
  * Deleted debian/shlibs.local, I doubt this hack is needed anymore.
    (It contained overrides for GL and OSMesa dependencies, other OpenGL
    packages (like nvidia-glx) probably have proper shlibs by now.)
  * Updated -l option for dh_shlibdeps to properly handle the way recent
    Wine versions are built. Added -L libwine, too.
  * After generating amd64.tar.lzma.uu, debian/rules will now try to update
    the source package with it if I set the DEB_FIXDIFF environment variable.
    That means I only have to rebuild the package once, not twice, before
    I can upload it. Yay.
  * And I can set DEB_SAVEBUILD to avoid having to recompile everything
    if I want to tweak the packaging further... double-yay.

wine (0.9.48-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.48.
    - Still more fixes for regression test failures.
    - Much more complete cryptnet implementation.
    - WIDL is now able to generate the oleaut32 proxy code.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Oct 26, 2007.
  * Upgraded debhelper compatibility level from 3 to 4.
  * Renamed debian/*.files to debian/*.install, and use
    dh_install instead of dh_movefiles in debian/rules.
  * Added some ia32 compatibility libraries to Build-Deps, for amd64.
  * Tweaked debian/rules to build 32-bit Wine and 64-bit Wine
    in separate directories. This won't do much yet, though;
    since I haven't yet researched how to actually *install*
    both versions so they will work together, Win64 support
    isn't enabled yet.
  * However, I did set up debian/rules so that if you delete the
    debian/amd64.tar.lzma.uu file after unpacking the Wine source
    package, 32-bit Wine will automatically be built from source,
    using the system's 32-bit cross compiler and libraries.
    This may result in a Wine package with reduced functionality
    compared to a natively-built 32-bit Wine, but is an option
    for whoever may prefer it this way.
    (If you leave the file there, and you're building on amd64,
    32-bit Wine will be unpacked from there instead of compiled,
    which should preserve all the natively-built features.)
  * Moved the d3d10, d3dim, d3drm, and d3dxof DLLs to libwine-gl.
  * Added a couple of previously missing Replaces to debian/control
    while at it.

    - New Bidi text implementation that doesn't depend on libicu.
    - The usual assortment of Direct3D improvements.
    - Beginning of I/O completion ports support.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Sep 28, 2007.
  * Removed libicu*-dev from Build-Depends.
    (Bah, figures that they'd remove the ICU dependency now,
    after all that effort spent on ICU in Debian...)
  * bin2res no longer exists, so not installed into wine-utils
    anymore.

    - A number of fixes to sound support.
    - Many more WordPad features.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Sep 14, 2007.
  * After losing access to my other workstations, I haven't had
    access to a Debian system for a while. However, now I've
    installed a VMware virtual machine with Debian on a Windows
    laptop, and appear to be able to build packages inside it...
  * Fixed grep-dctrl build-dependency (that package was renamed
    to dctrl-tools long ago).

wine (0.9.44-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.44. (Closes: #421510, #433064.)
    - Better heuristics for making windows managed.
    - Automatic detection of timezone parameters.
    - Improvements to the builtin WordPad.
    - Better signatures support in crypt32.
    - Still more gdiplus functions.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Aug 24, 2007.
  * Applied patch to debian/rules for parallelized builds.
    Closes: #440937.
  * Adjusted architecture field on libwine-capi to match
    the list on libwine-alsa.
  * Made the wine metapackage only depend on libwine-capi
    on architectures where it's actually built.
  * Updated the package list in README.Debian since the main
    binary package was renamed to wine-bin. Also deleted the
    section about the removal of wine.conf, as that's many
    years ago.
  * Upgraded debhelper compatibility level from 2 to 3.
    (I might go on to 4 when I'm sure that this level works).
  * Deleted ldconfig from the libwine postinst and postrm
    scripts, depending on debhelper to autogenerate them
    instead. Deleted the files since there was nothing
    left in them.
  * Deleted wine-bin.install. Install the two files that
    were listed there directly from debian/rules along with
    all the other manually-installed files of a similar nature.
    (This is to make a future transition from dh_movefiles
    to dh_install easier. The manual install rules could be
    cleaned up (moved back into .install files) afterwards,
    but right now I don't want them complicating things.)
  * Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.6.2
    (the wineserver is already in /usr/lib/wine, as it
    should be according to policy).
  * Fixed the unsubstituted @libdir@ in the wine manpage
    (should now properly say /usr/lib/wine/wineserver,
    instead of @libdir@/wine/wineserver).
  * Installed the net.exe application into wine-utils.
  * Installed the ntoskrnl.exe DLL into libwine.
  * Installed the winedevice.exe service into wine.
  * Building the package on a different computer; seems the
    hard drive on my regular system is starting to fail
    and I cannot rule out the possibility that my 0.9.43
    upload contained partially corrupted binaries.

wine (0.9.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.43.
    - Direct3D support on top of WGL instead of GLX for better portability.
    - Many DirectSound fixes.
    - Still more gdiplus functions.
    - Many crypt32 improvements.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Aug 10, 2007.
  * Deleted the move_to_fhs debconf template from libwine, as it
    pertains to a transition that happened many years ago.
    This was the only debconf template in libwine.
    Closes: #440365.
  * Deleted the move_to_fhs check from the libwine preinst script.
    This was the only debconf usage in libwine; it no longer uses debconf.
  * Deleted the rest of the libwine preinst script too, it only
    applied to very old Wine installations. Deleted the file.
  * Deleted the del_wine_conf debconf template from wine-bin, as it
    also pertains to a transition that happened many years ago.
  * Deleted the del_wine_conf check from the wine-bin configure script.
    This was the only thing in it. Deleted the file.
  * Deleted the del_wine_conf check from the wine-bin postinst script.
    This was the only debconf usage in wine-bin; it no longer uses debconf.
  * Deleted the wine-bin postrm script. It only deleted wine.conf
    on purge, and wine.conf should have been deleted long ago.
  * Deleted the install_type template from wine-bin, as this template has
    not been used for years, if ever, and judging by the direction Wine
    development is heading, will never be used again.
    This was the only remaining debconf template in wine-bin.
  * Deleted the po/ directory, since no debconf templates remain
    whatsoever.
  * Due to deletion, the bug in po/POTFILES.in (obsolete filename after
    renaming wine to wine-bin) no longer apply. Closes: #440412.
  * Deleted debconf-related dependencies from the control file.
  * Deleted debconf-related commands from the rules file.
  * Due to deletion, new debconf translations no longer apply.
    Closes: #427024, #440730.

  * Removed some stuff in debian/rules that were supposed to allow

    on architectures where the other packages also exist.
    (Then I could later also make it depend on things like
    libwine-alsa and libwine-capi only on platforms where it's
    actually possible to build them.)

    I also replaced Source-Version with binary:Version in the control

    - File I/O performance improvements.
    - The usual assortment of Direct3D fixes.

  * This version was released Apr 13, 2007.
  * Applied patch by Robert Millan to rename the current "wine" package
    to "wine-bin", and make "wine" a metapackage that depends on all the
    other packages. (I'm very much in doubt whether packages like
    libwine-capi, which probably nobody has used for years, really should
    be depended on by such a metapackage, but I've left it as "everything"
    for now.) Closes: #416525.
  * Removed the libwine-arts package.
  * Split wineoss into a new libwine-oss package. While
    (at least under Linux) wineoss do not actually have any
    extra dependencies to worry about, nor is it very large,
    this does allow the metapackage's dependency on "at least
    one libwine sound driver package" to make more sense,
    for those users who's only using OSS.
  * Installed the hh and xcopy tools into wine-utils.
  * Installed the spoolsv service into libwine-print.
  * Add libcupsys2 as an alternative dependency to libcupsys2-gnutls10.

    using winelauncher as some kind of instruction for the *user*
    to use it, so maybe this helps). Closes: #409556.

wine (0.9.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.2.
    - Winelib Explorer app (just a wrapper around winefile for now).
    - Debugger cleanups and improvements.
    - Many wininet fixes.
    - Better autogenerated API manpages.
    - A bunch of Korean translations.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Nov 22, 2005.
  * Installed the explorer program into wine-utils.
  * Renamed wineeject back to eject, and decided to go with upstream's
    way to avoid the naming conflict: launch with "wine eject", not
    with a wrapper script in /usr/bin.
  * Grabbed the WMF patch by Marcus Meissner from Wine CVS.
    It suppresses the dispatch of SETABORTPROC escapes from metafile
    records (dlls/gdi/metafile.c). Some security-minded people seem to
    want this to be fixed right away, even though it's obvious Wine
    could never be a 100% secure program.
    Closes: #346197.

wine (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9.1.
    - Support for Find function in regedit.
    - Winelib app to eject a CD.
    - Many MSI improvements.
    - Better support for running text-mode apps without X.
    - Improved support for various code obfuscation tools.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * This version was released Nov 9, 2005. I know it's a bit
    late to package this, but I've been on vacation. I also
    know that there are newer releases, but my philosophy
    continues to be to catch up one release at a time (in
    case the newest one breaks stuff for someone), so just
    wait, and I'll get to the newest one.
  * Install the eject tool into the wine package, as it may
    be useful for installers (it doesn't just eject, it also
    forces wine to unmount the CD, closing any open files if
    necessary) and isn't very large. The tool is installed as
    wineeject, instead of eject, to avoid naming conflicts.
  * Added libxt-dev and libxmu-dev to build dependencies.
    Removed libgl1-mesa-dri-dev from build dependencies,
    as the X.Org Mesa (xlibmesa-gl-dev) is preferred.
    Closes: #336576, #337466, #338508, #343870.
  * I'm now building with libicu34-dev. Wine is written to
    link statically with ICU, but Debian's libicu34-dev
    does not provide static libraries (unlike the previous
    libicu28-dev), so I'm hacking it to link dynamically
    for now. As a result, the binary package now has a hard
    dependency on libicu34. I've notified the ICU maintainer
    of the situation.
  * Added Vietnamese debconf translation. Closes: #324126.
  * Install wineserver man page (finally). Closes: #83238.
  * Force libwine-dev man pages to live in /usr/share/man/man3
    instead of /usr/share/man/man3w.

wine (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 0.9. Closes: #326805.
    - After 12 years of development, this release marks the beginning of the
    - beta testing phase.  Everybody is encouraged to try it; while there
    - are still bugs, most applications are expected to at least install and
    - do something useful.
  * This version was released Oct 25, 2005.
  * Package description changes:
    "Windows Emulator" => "Windows API Implementation"
    "Binary Emulator" => "Binary Loader"
    "ALPHA release" => "BETA release"
    "developers release" => "work in progress"
    "MS-Windows emulator" => "free MS-Windows API implementation"
    "emulator program" => "binary loader program"
    Closes: #313189.
  * Added libxslt1-dev to Build-Depends.

wine (0.0.20050930-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made Build-Depends compatible with sarge, by making
    "xlibs-static-dev (<< 6)" an alternative for "libxkbfile-dev",
    "libxxf86dga-dev", and "libxxf86vm-dev", and compatible with
    potato (presumably) by making "xlibs-dev" an alternative for
    "libxrender-dev". All "xlibs-dev" alternatives were also
    strictified into "xlibs-dev (<< 4.3)". Closes: #333997.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 15 Oct 2005 03:24:22 -0400

wine (0.0.20050930-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Build-Depends to reflect new X.org package split;
    Xrender was probably not compiled in in my last couple of
    uploads, but it should be now.

wine (0.0.20050930-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050930.
    - Joystick force feedback support.
    - Beginnings of Win64 support.
    - Many MSI fixes and cleanups.
    - Font linking support.
    - Several OLE fixes.
    - Some fixes for MacOS/x86.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * The changelog reports a change to the shell icon cache
    that should reduce memory requirements, which hopefully
    fixes #332545 (not closing it before it's confirmed).
  * Added Swedish debconf translation. Closes: #331188.
  * Added Portuguese debconf translation. Closes: #331497.

wine (0.0.20050830-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050830.
    - A lot more theming support.
    - Many improvements to the various crypto dlls.
    - More LDAP support.
    - Beginnings of an MSXML implementation.
    - Better MSHTML support.
    - Emulated version now set to Windows 2000 by default.
    - Direct3D fixes and improvements.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Added libxml2-dev to Build-Depends, but did not split msxml3
    into a separate package. This means the core libwine package
    will now depend on libxml2, but I believe that's okay. It's
    a fairly common library, and msxml3 is likely to be same.
  * Install new LDAP library into new libwine-ldap package.
    Added libldap2-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Install new EsounD driver into new libwine-esd package.
    Added libesd0-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Install mscms into new libwine-cms package, since libcms1
    seems to have become a hard dependency for mscms. Removed
    the libcms1 from libwine's Suggests.
  * Added debconf-2.0 as an alternative debconf dependency.
  * Fixed wine-safe's prompting of user. Closes: #327261.
  * Built against libjack0.100.0-dev. Closes: #321222.

    - Beginnings of theme support in common controls.
    - Many MSHTML improvements.
    - A bunch of OLE fixes for InstallShield installers.
    - Many Direct3D fixes and improvements.
    - Beginnings of LDAP support.
    - Various cleanups after removal of the config file.

wine (0.0.20050628-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * One of the Debian patches must have suffered bitrot,
    at least the current incarnation removed an important line
    from regedit. I've put that line back. Closes: #318669.

 -- Ove Kaaven <ovek@arcticnet.no>  Sat, 16 Jul 2005 21:19:52 -0400

wine (0.0.20050628-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050628 (closes: #318472).
    - Configuration settings moved to the registry.
    - Graphical Wine configuration tool is now enabled.
    - More MSI and OLE improvements.
    - Reorganisation of the DirectDraw directory.
    - Initial support for webcams.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Made wineprefixcreate look for wineserver where I placed it,
    by default. Closes: #312254.
  * Applied corrections to German debconf translation.
    Closes: #313860.
  * The Wine packages no longer build-depend on c2man.
    Closes: #313266.
  * The wine.conf man page has been removed.
  * The config file in /usr/share/wine/skel has been removed.
  * The sample config file in /usr/share/wine/doc has been removed.
  * Install Win32 API man pages into the libwine-dev package.
  * Install msiexec into the wine package.
  * The winecfg tool is already in wine-utils, not sure whether
    it's necessary to move it into the main Wine package or not.

wine (0.0.20050524-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050524.
    - Many MSI improvements.
    - More features in the file manager.
    - Better compatibility for Winelib import libraries.
    - SGML documentation moved out of the source tree.
    - Header files cleanups.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * wine-doc is no longer built from the Wine sources.
    Had to move ChangeLog.OLD into the main Wine package.
  * Added Japanese debconf translation. Closes: #307013.
  * Added Brazilian Portuguese debconf translation. Closes: #310654.

wine (0.0.20050419-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050310.
    - Mailslot support.
    - Support for side mouse buttons (X buttons).
    - More Richedit improvements.
    - Loading of Windows registry files disabled for now.
    - Many code cleanups.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Acknowledge security NMU. Closes: #300306.
  * Split OpenGL and Direct3D functionality into separate libwine-gl
    package. Closes: #304815.
    Some people prefer split packages, some prefer merged packages,
    it's hard to please everyone. But since the contents of the
    libwine-print doesn't actually require a hard dependency on CUPS,
    I'll consider merging its contents into the main libwine package
    soon anyway, at least if people keep asking me why they can't print.
  * Added Suggests for libwine-gl to libwine. Though perhaps these
    suggestions should be on the wine package, not libwine?
  * Moved wineboot and regedit from wine-utils to wine. These can be
    essential to installing certain applications and you probably
    shouldn't need wine-utils to do that.
  * Install wine.desktop into /usr/share/applications instead of
    /usr/share/applnk, and use updated wine.desktop from Dan Korostelev.
    Closes: #214707.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Mar 2005 10:38:43 -0500

wine (0.0.20050310-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20050310.
    - Initial implementation of a true Richedit control.
    - Shell extension for browsing Unix directories.
    - More MSI work.
    - PBuffer support in OpenGL.
    - Window painting regressions should be fixed.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Since stdole32.tlb.so is available, I suppose I could close the
    "stdole32.tlb doesn't exist" bug. Closes: #226903.
  * Since I'm now up to date, I will close the "new upstream version"
    bug. Closes: #271581.
  * Added Czech debconf translation. Closes: #298318.
    (With the way the Wine configuration is going, the debconf stuff
    should probably be removed, though. So far I've just held hope
    that they'd re-add some kind of multi-user capability someday.)
  * Someday I need to get around to remove old cruft, and use the
    latest standards, in the packaging. But since Wine has been
    suffering various breakages lately, I have an excuse for waiting
    a little longer.

    - Still more work on the MSI dll.
    - More OLE work, including a builtin stdole32.tlb.
    - Fixed inter-process window resize and repaint.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Install *.tlb.so files into the libwine package.
  * Install manpages for winegcc and wineg++ into libwine-dev.

    - Update regions now handled in the Wine server.
    - Beginnings of typelib generation in the IDL compiler.
    - Many janitorial cleanups.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * There are rumors that the OLE changes may break InstallShield.
    If that concerns you, you could wait for some Wine 200503xx
    or something release to appear before you upgrade, or pick up
    an earlier Wine release by using http://snapshot.debian.net.

    - Implementation of the RSAENH dll.
    - More work on the Direct3D 9 architecture.
    - Builtin debugger improvements.
    - Reorganisation of the Developer's Guide.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Removed winesetup from wine's Suggests: line.
  * Allow compilation with libicu28-dev.

wine (0.0.20041019-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20041019.
    - Beginnings of an architecture for Direct3D 9 support.
    - Many debugger regressions fixed.
    - Improvements to the IDL compiler and the COM headers.
    - New MSCMS dll (color management support).
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Mention Scott Ritchie's Wine packages in README.Debian.
    Since I have been sick a lot lately, I have not had time
    to review these packages yet, but I can at least mention
    them. After I bring the current Debian packages up to
    date, I'll review his packages, and if I like them, I may
    turn over maintainership to him. Until then, I'm only
    mentioning his packages with caution.
  * Suggest "icu" in libwine, since libicu21c102 apparently
    does not depend on it itself. Closes: #290158.
    (Should get around to building with the newer libicu28
     later on, since it has been available for a while now.)
  * Make winelauncher no longer tell you to configure Wine
    if there is no ~/.wine/config, since Wine no longer needs
    a config file.
  * Install control.exe.so and winver.exe.so into wine-utils,
    although I can't imagine a great use for them. Closes: #289163.
  * Install msiexec.exe.so into wine, since it can be useful
    for installers.
  * Added lib1cms1-dev to the build deps, for MSCMS.
    Added liblcms1 to Suggests for libwine. There's probably no
    point creating a separate libwine package for CMS.
  * Added fontforge to the build deps, for the bitmap fonts.
  * Install fonts (/usr/share/fonts/wine) into the libwine package.

    - New ITSS dll (for HTML Help support).
    - Many compatibility fixes in the exported headers.
    - Replacements for the Windows standard bitmap fonts.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Seems the documentation files are generated as *.htm now,
    not *.html. Not sure when this happened, but the doc-base
    files are now changed to reflect this. Closes: #285669.
  * Added Dutch debconf translation. Closes: #283975.
  * The wineclipsrv no longer exist, so it doesn't need

  * Acknowledge NMU. Closes: #267536.
  * Make winelauncher report exit status on stderr, not stdout.
    Closes: #271667.
  * Description of libwine-alsa now just says it's for ALSA, not for
    ALSA 0.9. Closes: #275018.
  * Change the wine manpage to reflect where I put the wineserver.
    Closes: #278057.
  * Forgot to close bug for the winelauncher patch I applied in 20040716-1,
    so do it now: Closes: #260993.
  * winedbg now has a man page. Closes: #83266.
  * Removed extra ftbuild.h inclusions added long ago, but that are no
    longer necessary.

  * Applied winelauncher patch from Kevin Shanahan which allows
    each $WINEPREFIX to have its own flag files to disable
    prelaunch and debug windows.
  * Remove binfmt-support-specific doubledash hack from winelauncher,
    it's apparently no longer needed (nor does it work anymore).
    Closes: #261855.

    This may not change existing installations, it may be necessary for
    you to change the registry entry yourself on existing installations.
    I've mentioned how to do this in README.Debian.
    (It may be possible to make winebrowser ignore the registry entry
    entirely and hardcode it to always use sensible-browser, but I
    am not sure if that's a good idea.)

    - First version of wineprefixcreate tool for initial setup.
    - Lots of bug fixes.

    Closes: #238065.
  * Install taskmgr into wine-utils.
  * Set ICUUC_LIB and ICUDATA_LIB variables for configure,
    needed to compile this Wine release against the old ICU
    version in Debian, as instructed by Shachar Shemesh.
  * Adapted skeleton wine configuration in /usr/share/wine/skel
    to contain DOS device and drive symlinks. For existing
    installs, it seems wine will convert the old config to the
    new symlink-based scheme automatically, for a limited
    transition period. But I thought it best to update the
    packaging now anyway, to make sure I got it right before
    it's too late.
  * Install wineprefixcreate into wine. This seems to be
    an alternative to copying /usr/share/wine/skel into ~/.wine.
  * Added Danish debconf translation. Closes: #234064.

wine (0.0.20040309-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20040309
    - Much improved winegcc tool, now used to build Wine itself.
    - VxDs are now separate libraries for better modularity.
    - Improvements and simplifications to the drive configuration.
    - New setupapi INF script to create the initial registry.
    - Many improvements to the various multimedia dlls.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Moved skeleton wine configuration from /usr/share/wine to
    /usr/share/wine/skel. Updated README.Debian to reflect this.
  * Install patched tools/wineinstall into /usr/share/wine.
    If the script happens to work, it might be better to use it
    than copying the /usr/share/wine/skel into ~/.wine, since
    it would also be able to upgrade an old installation, and
    has more tweaks, but I haven't tested this script much lately.
  * Moved wineconf from /usr/lib/wine to /usr/share/wine.
  * Install generic.ppd and wine.inf in /usr/share/wine.
  * There's no longer a winedefault.reg. Everything is handled by
    wine.inf. Added explanation on how to use wine.inf to
    README.Debian.
  * Create program symlinks manually in debian/rules instead of
    using dh_link, since these symlinks must be absolute, otherwise
    they won't work when "cp -r"-ed into ~/.wine. Closes: #235406.
  * Try to make winelauncher look for an existing config file
    in $WINEPREFIX (before complaining that you have to run
    winesetup). Closes: #235405.

  * There's now a man page for winebuild. Closes: #114673.
  * Update libwine-* package list in README.Debian.

wine (0.0.20040213-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20040213
    - Improved support for screen resolution changes.
    - More shell32 improvements.
    - Several Winelib compatibility fixes.
    - Beginnings of support for typelib creation.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Moved wine.bin, wine-[kp]thread and wineserver from wine to libwine,
    since these are going to be needed for Winelib programs too.
  * Added winebrowser and expand to the wine package.
  * Added libfontconfig1-dev, libssl-dev, and libcapi20-2 to
    Build-Depends.
  * Added new package libwine-capi to contain the capi20 module.

wine (0.0.20040121-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high since this should hit testing as
    soon as possible (both to help jack migration, and
    to supersede the currently NPTL-incompatible version
    in testing).
  * Fixed debian/rules to also make libwine-jack depend
    on libjack0.80.0-0. Sorry for the mistake.
  * Put dlls/twain/README into the libwine-twain package.
    Closes: #224941.

wine (0.0.20040121-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20040121
    - Many improvements in the shell32 dll.
    - Better support for constructors in C++ Winelib apps.
    - Improved Regedit tool.
    - Full support for graphic tablets.
    - Lots of DirectMusic improvements.
    - Better support for video playback.
    - Full IME support for Asian locales.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * The exec shield workaround was also disabled again upstream
    "because it caused too much trouble". Perhaps #224837 was
    some of that trouble. Need verification.
  * Build-Depend on libjack0.80.0-dev instead of libjack0.71.2-dev.
    Closes: #228786.

wine (0.0.20031212-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20031212
    - Initial implementation of XDND drag&drop support.
    - Improved startup performance on remote displays.
    - Major improvements in the oleaut32 dll.
    - Some support for Netbios functions.
    - Work around for Exec Shield and prelinking troubles.
    - Many code cleanups.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * It seems regapi is no more, have to remove it from the
    packages. (A man page for it is not needed anymore then,
    which closes #83261)
  * The tool regedit supersedes it, so I'm using that now to
    build the skeleton configuration in /usr/share/wine. I
    patched regedit to accept input from stdin if a filename
    of "-" is given, so input can still be zcat-ed to it.
  * Updated README.Debian for regedit instead of regapi, and
    mention that regedit is in wine-utils (still).

wine (0.0.20031118-1) unstable; urgency=low

    - Lots of code merges from Crossover Office 2.1.
    - Some reorganization of the source tree.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * Install wine.bin-kthread and wine.bin-pthread binaries into
    /usr/bin to allow the threading autoselection to work.
  * The DNS lookup issues is also claimed to have been fixed now,
    probably because of the NPTL detection. Closes: #214252.
  * Added winecpp to libwine-dev.

wine (0.0.20031016-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20031016
    - Support for the Xrandr extension.
    - Dll separation of kernel and ntdll is finished.
    - Many enhanced metafile improvements.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * DocBook DSSSL stylesheets are apparently no longer included in the
    upstream source. However, they have one available separately
    (in the "tools" module of CVS), so I put it into the debian/
    directory and let the debian/rules file generate the documentation
    itself (without using upstream makefile) using that stylesheet.
    I also chose to continue to build each book as many small HTML
    files instead of as one big HTML file, since that's the "tried and
    true" way, or something.
  * Some old plaintext documentation has also been removed upstream,
    they've been removed from the packaging too.
  * Added HURD and FreeBSD to architecture fields, as requested.
    Closes: #222227.

wine (0.0.20030911-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20030911
    - Many improvements to the winecfg configuration tool.
    - Massive header files cleanup for better source compatibility.
    - Some more progress on the kernel/ntdll separation.
    - Lots of bug fixes.
    (Yes, newer upstream releases exist, I plan to upload each of
     them with a few days in between to allow them to be archived
     on snapshot.debian.net)
  * Install rpcss, rundll32, start, winemenubuilder into libwine.
  * Install *.def files into libwine-dev.
  * Build-depend on libicu-dev, so that support for non-Western
    languages gets compiled in. Suggest libicu21c102 for libwine.
  * Added missing "]" in winedefault.reg. Closes: #218612.
  * Fixed doc-base (it apparently got broken after the wine-doc
    changes). Closes: #215393.
  * Fixed dash compatibility of winelauncher. Closes: #219624.
  * Noted that daily builds haven't been working lately
    in README.Debian. Closes: #213729.
  * Tried to fix configure to detect current freetype.
  * Started rewriting the build system a little bit to make it
    possible to make winelauncher configure Wine automatically
    without winesetup's help. This is not finished yet, though,
    and since I'm far behind on Wine releases now, I think I'll
    do it later. Still, I did get around to po-debconfify the
    still unused debconf templates (closes: #203286), and put
    a skeleton per-user no-Windows configuration into
    /usr/share/wine that it's possible to copy into ~/.wine for
    those who want to do so.
  * Updated README.Debian to reflect (some of) the above.
  * /var/lib/wine/drivec is no longer in the package.

wine (0.0.20030813-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pthread changes in current glibc CVS caused Wine to not work.
    This has to be fixed both Wine-side and glibc-side. This upload
    fixes it on the Wine side by applying a patch from WineHQ CVS
    for this. Closes: #210300.
    (The glibc side is bug #210347, which must also be fixed before
    Wine runs again, sorry.)

  * Place winspool.drv into libwine, not libwine-print, so that programs
    that link to it don't need libwine-print. Closes: #202050.
  * Remove stale libwine.so and libwine_unicode.so symlinks
    in preinst. Closes: #202116.
  * Build-depend on libjack0.71.2-dev instead of libjack0.50.0-dev.
    I am not sure that this jack version will work with Wine, but since
    0.50.0 is apparently no longer in unstable, I guess I have no choice.
    Closes: #202237.
  * Changed wine-doc build rules a bit to be more in line with upstream
    documentation layout. This will change the directory layout in the
    wine-doc package, you may have to adjust your bookmarks. Closes: #202310.
  * Added winecfg program to wine-utils.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.6.0, rearranged debian/rules file
    a bit to have a separate binary-indep rule for building wine-doc.
  * Corrected sections in control file (finally).

  * Found out that wine was never ported to alpha after all (the alpha
    references in the win32 headers must be from NT or something, there's
    apparently no actual code in Wine for alpha), so I removed that again.
    Now only i386, powerpc, and sparc remain.

  * Make it possible to build from source with libjack0.71.2. However,
    I'm not convinced that the code might work with a new jack version,
    so I'll still be compiling against the older version myself.
    Closes: #196014.
  * Since people keep complaining about libwine-arts depending on arts
    4:2.2.2, without telling me what's wrong with that, I now
    depend on arts 1.1.2, clearly an even older arts, but if they can't

  * Changed short description of wine-utils from "Wine Emulator"
    to "Windows Emulator" to match the other binary packages...
  * Install wine.xpm and wine_small.xpm into /usr/share/pixmaps.

wine (0.0.20011108-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20011108
    - Shared windows support starts doing something useful.
    - Overlapped I/O improvements.
    - Support for running files from removable media.
    - Many shlwapi improvements.
    - Quartz dll keeps growing.
    - Lots of bug fixes (Closes: #115319).

  * Tried to add a KDE file association (Closes: #118430).

    to make Wine launch on left-click, only on right-click
    and then selecting WINE), please let me know.

wine (0.0.20011004-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20011004
    - Beginnings of shared window handles.
    - Much improved typelib support.
    - Tons of new code in quartz dll.
    - Lots of bug fixes (Closes: #109668).
  * The specmaker tool has been replaced by the winedump tool
    (Closes: #87552).
  * This release was apparently badly timed (it was exceedingly broken).
    However, one day after the release, all the major breakages were
    fixed in the CVS tree (i.e. business as usual in the Wine project).
    So I've applied the current CVS patches to make this Debian
    release somewhat useful.

    - A few more steps towards dll separation
    - Lots of bug fixes

    - Better font metrics support in Postscript driver using Freetype
    - Major window management redesign (still in progress)

wine (0.0.20010510-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added CUPS build dependency, and installed it on my build
    machines, so users that need printing can take advantage of
    Wine's new support for CUPS.
  * Moved sample config files potentially referenced from postinst
    from /usr/share/doc/wine to /usr/share/wine, and added symlinks
    to them in /usr/share/doc/wine, as per Debian policy.
  * There's a new generic.ppd among the sample config files, I'm
    not sure what to do with it other than stuff it into
    /usr/share/doc/wine.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.5.4.

wine (0.0.20010326-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Serial async I/O improvements
    - Support for app-specific dll overrides in config file
    - Lots of bug fixes.
  * New build dependency libperl-dev (because of the new
    winetest program, which is supposed to be wine's new
    API test suite, but though it was necessary to compile
    it, I don't think it's useful to have in the debian
    packages, is it?)
  * There's a new winecheck script too, but I didn't include
    it either, as I'm not sure how it works and whether it
    would be useful in Debian packages.
  * Made the dependency on xbase-clients versioned >= 4.0,
    so it doesn't satisfy potato xfree86 3.x users, forcing
    the ORed xcontrib dependency instead.
  * Added Suggests: msttcorefonts (neat package).
  * Moved documentation/samples/* from libwine to wine.
  * Implemented DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS stuff.
    Upgraded Standards-Version to 3.5.2.

    the config.cache with a debian/config.anticache in rules.
    Sadly, users most likely can no longer use plain old non-GLX
    Mesa (without hardware acceleration) to play Half-Life at 0.2 fps
    anymore, but maybe that's no big loss anyway.
    Closes: #83391, #83393.
  * Removed MesaGL mess explanation from README.Debian again.
  * Changed german translation of libwine.templates. Closes: #87604.

  * Made Wine a handler of the application/x-msdos-program MIME
    type. (Soon your Unix mailers will also be able to run all
    those Windows viruses, muahahaha...)
  * Added a GNOME file association for that too.
    (But I don't know how to do that for KDE... if there's anything
    extra I need to do to make it work in KDE too, send a patch
    to the bug tracker or something)
  * Moved winemaker manpage to where winemaker is now (wine-utils).
  * Added "undocumented" manpage for specmaker and wine.bin.

wine (0.0.20010216-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20010216.
    - Several PostScript driver enhancements.
    - Improved enhanced metafiles support.
    - Beginnings of PowerPC support.
    - Lots of bug fixes. (Closes: #83214)
  * libwine_tsx11.so is new, placed it in /usr/lib.
  * specmaker is new, placed it in wine-utils.
  * Updated README.Debian to explain the MesaGL mess.
  * Built with debhelper v3.
  * Moved winemaker from libwine-dev to wine-utils, since it's just a
    porting tool for preparing windows for winelib compilation, not
    a build requirement once the sources have been prepared.
  * Removed rpath hack from debian/rules, assuming that winelauncher
    does a good enough job (or recognizing that the upstream configure
    adds rpath itself so I wouldn't have to anyway).
  * Patched winelauncher a lot, so now it works without rpath in the
    Debian packaging, and works with the winelib apps.
  * Moved /usr/lib/*.so symlinks to libwine-dev.
  * Finally moved the /var/lib/wine stuff from libwine to wine.
  * Someone apparently translated libwine.templates to German.
    While not terribly useful (the first message might be obsolete
    and the other isn't actually used, at least not right now),
    especially not without also translating wine.templates, I just
    threw it into libwine.templates anyway to close the bug.
    Closes: #83366.

    xlibosmesa3, so that users that use mesag3 can just add a symlink
    (or mesag3 can be made to provide such a symlink itself).
    On the other hand, would adding a Build-Conflicts: xlibosmesa-dev
    (and build without OSMesa support) be a better idea...?
  * Removed bashism from winelauncher script. Closes: #83559.

wine (0.0.20010112-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20010112.
    This version of Wine unfortunately doesn't support a global config
    file, so the default wine.conf is now removed from the package.
    I'll just have to recommend using winesetuptk for now.
  * Using debconf to notify the sysadmin of the above issue, and ask
    whether to delete /etc/wine.conf.
  * Decided to use winelauncher like it was intended; rename the main
    wine binary to wine.bin, and rename winelauncher to wine.
    This will also automatically launch winesetup if there's no config.
  * Removing wine.conf in postrm if wine is purged.

wine (0.0.20001222-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ldconfig to libwine.postinst.
  * Now that winesetuptk is available, I added winesetup to Suggests,
    and mentioned it in README.Debian. The next Wine release ought to
    have support for a new global config file, I plan to remove wine.conf
    from the package once that happens.
  * Added information about other sources for Wine .deb packages
    (from the WineHQ download page) to README.Debian.

wine (0.0.20001222-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20001222.
    The configuration file format has changed, but I've kept the wine.conf
    in here since the winesetuptk tool isn't ready yet (I'm waiting for it
    to handle the new configuration file format), and wine will simply
    automatically generate a ~/.wine/config using the old wine.conf.
  * Updated README.Debian to explain these config issues.
  * Built more of the winelib apps, put some of them (including the
    all-important "winemine") into wine-utils.

wine (0.0.20001202-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 20001202.
    New tools winelauncher and wineshelllink.
    Updated wine.conf.
    (I ought to use winelauncher for something, maybe soon.)
  * Updated Build-Depends for XFree86 4.0.
  * Install regapi into wine. Closes: #76138, #47857.
    Also put winedefault.reg into wine instead of libwine.
    Will clean up the inconsistencies, such as drive setup
    and files being in libwine instead of wine, later.
  * Moved winebuild, wmc, and wrc from wine-utils and
    into libwine-dev, since these are tools required for
    compiling Winelib apps.
  * Added LDFLAGS with rpath set to /usr/lib/wine as arguments
    to make during build, so that regapi and winedbg works.
    Closes: #72243 (may have been closed by 20001026-2 too).
    Eventually DLL separation will remove the need for rpath,
    but I'll keep it until then.
  * Added a new fake drive for /usr/bin, so that wine can find
    winedbg.

    Closes: #69467, #69469, #69570, #70820, #71461.
  * The default wine.conf update and the libdir fix (and
    the repackaging) closes: #67381, #67382.
  * Reorganized wine-doc package, it now features HTML docs.
  * Took Windows directories with spaces out of the package proper,
    since debhelper didn't cope with them. Created them in postinst
    instead for now.
  * Some initial debconf support. But doing real configuration
    questions must wait until I've patched the upstream
    tools/wineinstall script for easier debconf integration.
  * Moved Drive C path from /usr/share/wine/drivec to
    /var/lib/wine/drivec for FHS compliance. (libwine.preinst takes
    care of moving the actual contents and performing a search &
    replace in wine.conf.) Closes: #70618, #70619, #70620.

  * Initialize win.ini and system.ini in Windows directory in
    libwine.postinst. (Hmm. Wonder if a --purge should remove everything?
    If the user only wanted to remove the .deb to compile wine himself,
    that might be a bad idea if the user installed something...)
