# Build an ELF depending on specified sonames.

# dpkg-shlibdeps can compute dependencies on dlopen'ed libraries with this ELF.
# Needed as workaround until this can be done directly with dpkg.  See
# https://bugs.debian.org/596715 (dpkg-shlibdeps: Please allow to manually add
# library dependencies via shlibdeps)
