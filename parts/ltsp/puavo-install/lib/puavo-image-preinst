# This script will be run for all device types that boot from local
# hard drive.  You should be able to read the device type from
# "/etc/puavo/hosttype".  If this script fails, new image will *not* be
# set as default.
#
# This script should be written so that it might be run once or many times,
# and always should do the right thing.
#
# The old image/system should now be mounted at /, and this new image
# should be mounted at /images/mnt.
#
# Note that grub-install and maybe some scripts should be run under chroot
# of the new system, or otherwise there may be missing dynamic libraries,
# or segfaults may occur in case system versions mismatch.
