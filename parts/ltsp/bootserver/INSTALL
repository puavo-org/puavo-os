Here are the post-installation configuration for puavo-ltsp-bootserver
package.  The puavo-ltsp-bootserver package it used to configure Puavo
bootservers, but unfortunately some configurations need to be slightly
edited by-hand for everything to work correctly.  Some suggestions
can safely be skipped if the corresponding functionality is not needed.

These settings have been tested with Ubuntu version 12.04.


Puavo-registration
------------------

You should register the bootserver to puavo with (run as root):

  puavo-register

This will create some files under /etc/puavo.

Make sure that the bootserver's hostname matches the hostname used in
registration.


Networking
----------

Right now puavo-ltsp-bootserver presumes that an interface named ltsp0 must
exist, and that is the interface to ltsp-network.  Create at least "ltsp0"
into /etc/network/interfaces.  An interface named "wlan0" is also recommended.


LTSP-images
-----------

You should put some LTSP-images to /opt/ltsp/images for nbd-server to serve.
Do:

  mkdir -p /opt/ltsp/images
  cp $YOUR_DEFAULT_LTSP_IMAGE /opt/ltsp/images/i386.img	# i386.img = default
  cp $YOUR_OTHER_LTSP_IMAGE   /opt/ltsp/images/other.img
  puavo-bootserver-generate-nbd-exports

You should also either restart nbd-server in case it does not support
re-reading configuration files after SIGHUP (this depends on its version).
Note that restarting nbd-server will cut off existing nbd connections.

Setup PXE-boot by creating /var/lib/tftpboot and copying the necessary files
there:

  puavo-bootserver-setup-pxe


DNS-setup
---------

For dynamic DNS setup to work, one should have either of the two lines
in /etc/sudoers (edit it with visudo(8)):

  dhcpd ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat /etc/puavo/ldap/password

OR:

  #includedir /etc/sudoers.d
 
  (TODO: more of this should be documented...)


NFS-setup
---------

For fatclients NFS needs to be setup.  So far only NFSv4.1 is supported.
The file /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server should contain these lines (in
addition to the default lines):

  NEED_SVCGSSD=yes
  RPCNFSDOPTS="--nfs-version 4.1"

Likewise, /etc/default/nfs-common should contain:

  NEED_IDMAPD=yes
  NEED_GSSD=yes

The puavo-ltsp-client package expects that /home can be mounted from the
bootserver, thus we need on /etc/exports:

  /export gss/krb5(rw,fsid=0,async,subtree_check,no_root_squash,crossmnt)
  /export/home gss/krb5(rw,async,subtree_check,no_root_squash)

In /etc/idmapd.conf, "Domain" should be set to your kerberos realm (the same
as in /etc/puavo/kerberos/realm after registering the host to Puavo):

  Domain = ...

On /etc/fstab there should be the following line:

  /home /export/home none rw,bind 0 0

Also /export/home should be created:

  mkdir -p /export/home

Do the following to get the NFS-configurations active:

  mount -a
  service nfs-kernel-server restart
  service idmapd restart


sssd configuration
------------------

/etc/nsswitch.conf should be configured to use sss.  Make sure that
the "passwd", "group", "shadow" and netgroup sections contain "sss", for
example:

  passwd:         compat sss
  group:          compat sss
  shadow:         compat sss

  netgroup:       nis sss

sssd also needs a bit of configuration.  /etc/sssd/sssd.conf should something
to the effect of:

  [sssd]
  services = nss, pam
  domains = KRBLDAP.FILL_IN_YOUR_KERBEROS_REALM_AT_/etc/puavo/kerberos/realm

  ...

  [domain/KRBLDAP.FILL_IN_YOUR_KERBEROS_REALM_AT_/etc/puavo/kerberos/realm]
  auth_provider = krb5
  cache_credentials = true
  id_provider = ldap
  dns_discovery_domain=FILL_IN_YOUR_DOMAIN_AT_/etc/puavo/domain
  krb5_server = _srv_,kerberos.FILL_IN_YOUR_DOMAIN_AT_/etc/puavo/domain
  krb5_realm = FILL_IN_YOUR_KERBEROS_REALM_AT_/etc/puavo/kerberos/realm
  krb5_validate = false
  ldap_default_bind_dn=FILL_IN_YOUR_LDAP_DN_AT_/etc/puavo/ldap/dn
  ldap_default_authtok=FILL_IN_YOUR_LDAP_PASSWORD_AT_/etc/puavo/ldap/password
  ldap_user_search_base = ou=People,FILL_IN_YOUR_LDAP_BASE_AT_/etc/puavo/ldap/base?sub?(objectClass=posixAccount)
  ldap_group_search_base = ou=Groups,FILL_IN_YOUR_LDAP_BASE_AT_/etc/puavo/ldap/base?sub?(objectClass=posixGroup)
  ldap_tls_reqcert = demand
  ldap_uri = _srv_,ldap://FILL_IN_YOUR_LDAP_MASTER_AT_/etc/puavo/ldap/master:389
  ldap_id_use_start_tls = true
  min_id = 500
  ldap_search_base = FILL_IN_YOUR_LDAP_BASE_AT_/etc/puavo/ldap/base
  krb5_store_password_if_offline = true
  ldap_user_fullname = displayName


Ldap configuration
------------------

You should run puavo-init-ds-slave -script (that is in puavo-ds-slave
package).  Note that this script actually touches some ldap- and
kerberos-related configuration files, so you should check out the
puavo-ds-slave package and its scripts to see if they do things that
suit your environment.

  puavo-init-ds-slave

You may also want to configure something like:

  BASE            FILL_IN_YOUR_LDAPBASE_AT_/etc/puavo/ldap/base
  NETWORK_TIMEOUT 15
  SASL_MECH       GSSAPI
  TIMEOUT         15
  TLS_CACERT      /etc/puavo/certs/rootca.pem
  TLS_REQCERT     demand
  URI             ldap://FILL_IN_YOUR_SERVER_FQDN

to /etc/ldap/ldap.conf for ldapsearch and other ldap-tools to work,
but this should not be strictly necessary.


Virtual LTSP-servers and thinclients
------------------------------------

If you need to serve thinclients (and not just fatclients), and you
do not have physical machines (other than the bootserver)) to do this,
you should setup a KVM virtual machine.  For example, you can create a
machine named "ltsp1", with:

  puavo-create-kvm-ltsp-server ltsp1

Then putting the line "ltsp1" to /etc/puavo/primary_ltsp_server should be a
good idea (this makes the created ltsp server the default ltsp server).


Load balancing and laptop updates
---------------------------------

Load balancing between LTSP servers requires nginx configuration.
Nginx is also used for distributing ltsp image binary patches
to laptops for updating laptops.  Load balancing is not strictly
required, but this may actually change soon, so it is a good idea
to enable it.  Laptop updates are only useful if you have puavo-laptops
installed.

  # enable puavo-rest / load balancing:
  sudo ln -fns /etc/nginx/sites-available/puavo-rest \
               /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/puavo-rest

  # enable ltsp-image / binary patch distribution (for laptops only)
  sudo ln -fns /etc/nginx/sites-available/ltsp-images \
               /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ltsp-images

  # make changes effective
  sudo service nginx reload


Cups
----

To setup cups to work with Puavo certificates do edit
/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.cupsd to contain the line:

  /etc/puavo/certs/* r,

Also do edit the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf file to contain the lines:

  ServerCertificate /etc/puavo/certs/host.crt
  ServerKey /etc/puavo/certs/host.key

Do restart apparmor and cups server:

  sudo service apparmor restart
  sudo service cups restart


Clock sync
----------

There is some code in puavo-ltsp-client to synchronise ltsp client clocks
from server.  To make use of this you need to uncomment the following line
in /etc/inetd.conf:

  time           stream  tcp     nowait  root    internal

Then restart inetd:

  sudo service openbsd-inetd restart
