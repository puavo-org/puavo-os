Usage
=====

To create and initialize an empty repository, run::

  mkdir myrepo
  cd myrepo
  aptirepo-init

Then, to import new packages to the repository in the current directory,
run::

  aptirepo-import /path/to/package.changes

It creates pool/ and copies packages into it. It also calls
aptirepo-update which generates dists/ based on the pool contents.

Optionally, if you want to import packages to a repository in some other
directory, run::

  APTIREPO_ROOT=/path/to/repository aptirepo-import /path/to/packages.changes
